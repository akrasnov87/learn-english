1
00:00:20,289 --> 00:00:25,289


2
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:27,191
I-Illumination!

3
00:00:27,193 --> 00:00:29,594
Yeah! Illumination!

4
00:00:29,596 --> 00:00:32,298
Whoo! Ha-ha-ha!

5
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:35,867
- Huh?
- Aw, man.

6
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:37,768
Aw.

7
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:39,503
Hmm. Whoa.

8
00:01:15,407 --> 00:01:18,173
Past the place
that you come from,

9
00:01:18,175 --> 00:01:20,343
far beyond what you've seen,

10
00:01:20,345 --> 00:01:22,845
is a town like your town,

11
00:01:22,847 --> 00:01:25,213
if your town was a dream.

12
00:01:31,622 --> 00:01:33,756
Only it's not a dream

13
00:01:33,758 --> 00:01:35,925
or a hoax or a ruse.

14
00:01:35,927 --> 00:01:38,760
- Morning!
- It is Christmas in Who-ville,

15
00:01:38,762 --> 00:01:40,862
- the home of the Whos.
- Hey!

16
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:42,297
Fresh peppermint bread!

17
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:45,233
- Oh, hey, Marge.
- Morning, Fred.

18
00:01:45,235 --> 00:01:47,569
Smells like Christmas.

19
00:01:51,207 --> 00:01:53,675
Whoa! Where are you going?

20
00:01:55,746 --> 00:01:57,746
- Hey, Tom.
- Good to see you, Ted.

21
00:01:59,215 --> 00:02:01,215
Wreath Man! Wreath Man!

22
00:02:01,217 --> 00:02:03,217
Here you go, kid.
Have a wreath.

23
00:02:03,219 --> 00:02:05,753
- Oh, cool!
- Merry Christmas to ya!

24
00:02:06,789 --> 00:02:08,222
Have a great day, dear!

25
00:02:08,224 --> 00:02:09,624
- You, too, hon! See you tonight!
- Hey!

26
00:02:09,626 --> 00:02:11,394
Hurry up! Morning.

27
00:02:25,775 --> 00:02:27,942
Yes, Who-ville is great,

28
00:02:27,944 --> 00:02:30,410
that is known far and wide,

29
00:02:30,412 --> 00:02:32,579
and three weeks
through December,

30
00:02:32,581 --> 00:02:35,215
this place hits its stride.

31
00:02:50,399 --> 00:02:52,999
Yes, the Whos
down in Who-ville

32
00:02:53,001 --> 00:02:55,835
like Christmas a lot.

33
00:02:58,439 --> 00:03:02,608
But the Grinch in his cave,
north of Who-ville...

34
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:04,978
did not.

35
00:03:22,897 --> 00:03:25,363
Hmm?

36
00:03:47,754 --> 00:03:50,287
Max...!

37
00:03:54,527 --> 00:03:56,994
Max...!

38
00:05:21,578 --> 00:05:23,745
Ooh!

39
00:05:35,858 --> 00:05:37,558
Ooh!

40
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,593
I am starving.

41
00:05:39,595 --> 00:05:40,594
Huh?

42
00:05:40,596 --> 00:05:42,462
Max.

43
00:05:42,464 --> 00:05:44,798
What is this depressing bean?

44
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,133
No, no, no, no, no, no.

45
00:05:46,135 --> 00:05:47,134
That's impossible.

46
00:05:47,136 --> 00:05:48,502
We can't be out of food.

47
00:05:48,504 --> 00:05:49,970
Wha...?

48
00:05:49,972 --> 00:05:52,471
Where's my personal reserve
of moose juice?

49
00:05:52,473 --> 00:05:53,807
And goose juice?

50
00:05:53,809 --> 00:05:55,809
My emergency stash of Who Hash?

51
00:05:55,811 --> 00:05:58,812
And my secret slew
of frozen Beezle-Nut stew?

52
00:06:00,615 --> 00:06:03,783
I specifically bought enough
food to last until January.

53
00:06:03,785 --> 00:06:06,586
How much emotional eating
have I been doing?

54
00:06:15,196 --> 00:06:17,029
No. I won't. I will not.

55
00:06:17,031 --> 00:06:19,732
I am not going to Who-ville
during Ch...

56
00:06:19,734 --> 00:06:21,567
Chri...

57
00:06:21,569 --> 00:06:23,703
Chri...

58
00:06:23,705 --> 00:06:25,671
Christmas! Ugh!

59
00:06:25,673 --> 00:06:27,472
Ugh!

60
00:06:30,577 --> 00:06:32,711
Fine. But I'm going to despise

61
00:06:32,713 --> 00:06:34,646
every second of it.

62
00:06:34,648 --> 00:06:37,183
Come on, Max.

63
00:06:38,886 --> 00:06:41,586
Yes, the Grinch
hated Christmas,

64
00:06:41,588 --> 00:06:43,889
the whole Christmas season.

65
00:06:43,891 --> 00:06:46,658
Now, please don't ask why.

66
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:48,793
No one quite knows the reason.

67
00:06:48,795 --> 00:06:50,962
It could be his head

68
00:06:50,964 --> 00:06:53,698
wasn't screwed on just right.

69
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:55,133
It could be perhaps that

70
00:06:55,135 --> 00:06:58,636
his shoes were too tight.

71
00:06:58,638 --> 00:07:01,772
But I think the most likely
reason of all

72
00:07:01,774 --> 00:07:04,042
may have been that his heart

73
00:07:04,044 --> 00:07:07,047
was two sizes too small.

74
00:07:12,718 --> 00:07:14,718
Now, remember, Max,

75
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,820
this is the time of year
when the Whos

76
00:07:16,822 --> 00:07:18,689
are at their most deceptive.

77
00:07:18,691 --> 00:07:20,691
You have my full permission

78
00:07:20,693 --> 00:07:25,563
to attack anyone who so much
as says one kind word to us.

79
00:07:26,598 --> 00:07:28,065
Okay, let's go.

80
00:07:28,067 --> 00:07:29,532
- Morning, fellas.
- Greetings.

81
00:07:29,534 --> 00:07:30,800
- Ready for Christmas?
- Greetings.

82
00:07:30,802 --> 00:07:32,769
Ah, good to see you.
How's work?

83
00:07:32,771 --> 00:07:34,171
Oh, could be better,
could be worse.

84
00:07:34,173 --> 00:07:36,639
Oh, hi. Merry Christmas.

85
00:07:36,641 --> 00:07:38,808
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait! Hold the bus!

86
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:40,877
- Wait. Stop. Oh, sor...
- Whoa!

87
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:42,912
- Coming through.
- Hey!

88
00:07:42,914 --> 00:07:46,649
Wait! Wait! Sam! Hold the bus!

89
00:07:46,651 --> 00:07:47,884
Oh!

90
00:07:47,886 --> 00:07:49,585
Whoa!

91
00:07:49,587 --> 00:07:51,688
- Whew! Oh!
- Sorry, Donna.

92
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:53,756
That's okay, Sam.

93
00:07:55,193 --> 00:07:57,193
Thanks for stopping.

94
00:07:57,195 --> 00:08:00,729
- Whew!
- They still got you on the night shift, huh?

95
00:08:00,731 --> 00:08:02,898
- Sure do.
- Oh, by the way,

96
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:06,001
Cindy-Lou forgot
her hockey... stick.

97
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:15,277
Hmm.

98
00:08:15,279 --> 00:08:17,982
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh. Thanks, mister.

99
00:08:18,983 --> 00:08:20,148
Ah-ha.

100
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:21,917
Hey!

101
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:23,251
- Hmm.
- Huh?

102
00:08:24,955 --> 00:08:27,122
You're a mean one, mister.

103
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:32,060
It's really such an awful day.

104
00:08:32,062 --> 00:08:33,228
- Hey! Merry Christmas!
- Huh?

105
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:35,563
Happy holidays, Sue.

106
00:08:35,565 --> 00:08:37,232
Good morning, Fred.

107
00:08:37,234 --> 00:08:39,100
Season's greetings, folks.

108
00:08:39,102 --> 00:08:41,202
And Merry Christmas to you...

109
00:08:45,641 --> 00:08:48,275
Ugh.

110
00:08:59,688 --> 00:09:01,888
Huh?

111
00:09:15,837 --> 00:09:18,638
Aah! Aah! Aah!

112
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:22,075
Aah...!

113
00:09:33,754 --> 00:09:35,621
Aah...!

114
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:51,170
Oh, hello.
Happy holi...

115
00:09:51,172 --> 00:09:52,838
Uh-uh.

116
00:10:08,922 --> 00:10:10,357
Blech!

117
00:10:17,864 --> 00:10:20,031
Ah. What's this?

118
00:10:20,033 --> 00:10:21,365
Excuse me.

119
00:10:21,367 --> 00:10:22,900
Are you getting that?

120
00:10:22,902 --> 00:10:25,169
I need it
for my Christmas stuffing.

121
00:10:25,171 --> 00:10:27,773
Mmm... no.

122
00:10:28,908 --> 00:10:31,177
Well, that's not very nice.

123
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,113
Oh, sugarplum!

124
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:44,688
Oh, no, I can't today.
I have a list of errands

125
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:47,691
a mile long, and the babysitter
left the sink backed up.

126
00:10:47,693 --> 00:10:49,860
No, I-I'm not complaining.
I'm venting.

127
00:10:49,862 --> 00:10:51,194
There's a difference.

128
00:10:51,196 --> 00:10:52,729
Okay. Uh, talk to you later.

129
00:10:52,731 --> 00:10:54,764
I-I have to get breakfast
on the table.

130
00:10:54,766 --> 00:10:58,767
Right after I unclog
this drain again.

131
00:10:58,769 --> 00:11:00,903
Ugh! It's like concrete!

132
00:11:00,905 --> 00:11:03,906
- Cindy-Lou, sweetheart, come eat.
- Coming!

133
00:11:03,908 --> 00:11:06,178
Oh.

134
00:11:09,981 --> 00:11:11,481
Buster,
we've talked about this.

135
00:11:11,483 --> 00:11:14,016
- Huh?
- Your brother's head is not breakfast.

136
00:11:16,988 --> 00:11:18,287
Uh?

137
00:11:18,289 --> 00:11:19,722
Blah!

138
00:11:23,494 --> 00:11:25,027
Ah!

139
00:11:32,869 --> 00:11:34,002
Okay.

140
00:11:34,004 --> 00:11:35,870
You all right, Mom?

141
00:11:35,872 --> 00:11:38,006
Me? Oh. Yes. Never better.

142
00:11:38,008 --> 00:11:41,042
Ah. What'd you put down here
anyway, a roller skate?

143
00:11:41,044 --> 00:11:43,512
No. Just batter.
Me and Ms. Wilbur made cookies.

144
00:11:43,514 --> 00:11:45,514
Oh. That explains it.

145
00:11:45,516 --> 00:11:47,348
- Come have some eggs.
- I can't.

146
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:49,517
I gotta go mail something.
But I made the beds

147
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:51,286
and put away the twins' toys.

148
00:11:51,288 --> 00:11:53,922
Thanks, sweetheart.
You didn't have to do that.

149
00:11:53,924 --> 00:11:55,356
I don't mind.

150
00:11:55,358 --> 00:11:57,959
- Something's burning.
- Just a second, sweetie.

151
00:11:57,961 --> 00:12:00,861
Bean, don't feed your brother
with your feet.

152
00:12:00,863 --> 00:12:02,530
- Mom! The toast!
- I got it!

153
00:12:11,106 --> 00:12:13,508
Wait. Where are you
going again?

154
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:15,776
- I told you. To mail a letter.
- Okay,

155
00:12:15,778 --> 00:12:17,411
but just come here first.

156
00:12:17,413 --> 00:12:19,315
Mom. I gotta go.

157
00:12:21,116 --> 00:12:24,218
All right.

158
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:25,818
Mwa!

159
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:28,121
Okay. Now you can go.

160
00:12:28,123 --> 00:12:29,822
Thanks, Mom.
Bye, Buster. Bye, Bean.

161
00:12:29,824 --> 00:12:31,458
Don't do anything
I wouldn't do.

162
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:33,527
Roger that, Mom.

163
00:12:33,529 --> 00:12:36,330
Whoo!

164
00:12:36,332 --> 00:12:39,333
Here goes Cindy-Lou Who
as she dashes through the snow

165
00:12:39,335 --> 00:12:41,867
with a very important letter!

166
00:12:41,869 --> 00:12:44,237
Oh, no!
I'm gonna miss the mailman!

167
00:12:44,239 --> 00:12:46,105
Shortcut!

168
00:12:46,107 --> 00:12:48,507
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

169
00:12:48,509 --> 00:12:50,243
Whoo! Whoa! Whoa!

170
00:12:50,245 --> 00:12:51,844
Whoa!

171
00:12:51,846 --> 00:12:54,380
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

172
00:12:54,382 --> 00:12:55,814
Bon appétit!

173
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:56,949
Whoo-hoo!

174
00:12:58,885 --> 00:13:00,819
Oh, no!

175
00:13:00,821 --> 00:13:02,020
Whoo!

176
00:13:02,022 --> 00:13:03,224
Aah...

177
00:13:04,259 --> 00:13:05,924
Watch out!

178
00:13:05,926 --> 00:13:07,892
Aah! Oh!

179
00:13:07,894 --> 00:13:09,294
No! My letter!

180
00:13:09,296 --> 00:13:11,162
What is wrong with you?

181
00:13:11,164 --> 00:13:12,931
Didn't you see me?
I mean, if that...

182
00:13:12,933 --> 00:13:15,233
if that was a sled, I-I...
well, I'd be dead.

183
00:13:15,235 --> 00:13:17,902
I'm sorry for bumping into you,
but this is really important.

184
00:13:17,904 --> 00:13:20,005
Have you seen my letter?

185
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:22,173
And that right there, Max,
is the true nature

186
00:13:22,175 --> 00:13:24,609
of the Who child:
just right to "me, me, me.

187
00:13:24,611 --> 00:13:27,178
- My letter. Me, me, me."
- No, you don't understand.

188
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:30,048
This isn't just a letter.
This is the letter.

189
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:32,049
Oh... really?

190
00:13:32,051 --> 00:13:34,586
Let me guess.
Small child, December 20,

191
00:13:34,588 --> 00:13:37,589
rabidly searching for a
"really important" lost letter?

192
00:13:37,591 --> 00:13:41,058
Might it be your list
of demands to Santa?

193
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:44,128
They're not demands.
It's more like a wish.

194
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:47,531
And what I'm wishing for
is really, really important.

195
00:13:47,533 --> 00:13:49,967
Well, then why send a letter?
I mean, if it's really

196
00:13:49,969 --> 00:13:52,169
that important, you should
just ask him face-to-face.

197
00:13:52,171 --> 00:13:56,006
Oh, but that's right:
no one's ever seen him.

198
00:13:56,008 --> 00:13:58,242
Mmm, my bad.

199
00:13:58,244 --> 00:14:01,010
Come on, Max,
let's get out of here.

200
00:14:01,012 --> 00:14:03,182
Bye, doggy.

201
00:14:18,129 --> 00:14:20,029
There he is, Max.

202
00:14:21,966 --> 00:14:23,633
The happiest Who alive.

203
00:14:23,635 --> 00:14:25,201
The unbearable...

204
00:14:25,203 --> 00:14:27,036
Bricklebaum.

205
00:14:27,038 --> 00:14:30,139
He thinks we're friends.

206
00:14:31,476 --> 00:14:33,309
Quick. Let's make a run for it.

207
00:14:33,311 --> 00:14:35,311
Go, go!

208
00:14:35,313 --> 00:14:37,079
Wha...? Wh-What was that?

209
00:14:37,081 --> 00:14:38,246
No.

210
00:14:58,202 --> 00:15:00,000
Oh, my goodness,

211
00:15:00,002 --> 00:15:03,572
Mr. Grinch! I-I-I'm coming!
Leave Mr. Grinch alone.

212
00:15:03,574 --> 00:15:05,574
That's one tough balloon
that you're fighting there.

213
00:15:05,576 --> 00:15:07,442
You old feisty frosty.

214
00:15:07,444 --> 00:15:09,009
Here, come on,
let me help you up.

215
00:15:09,011 --> 00:15:11,445
I-I-I do not want or need
your help.

216
00:15:11,447 --> 00:15:12,980
Oh. "Hair dye.

217
00:15:12,982 --> 00:15:15,149
Gorgeous Green Goddess."

218
00:15:15,151 --> 00:15:17,318
Oh. How did that get in there?

219
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,487
Hey, I'm sorry
if I made you uncomfy.

220
00:15:19,489 --> 00:15:22,156
We all got to keep
the gray away.

221
00:15:22,158 --> 00:15:25,159
I myself use
Chocolate Explosion.

222
00:15:25,161 --> 00:15:27,628
You know what? If you want
to apologize for something,

223
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:29,663
apologize for that.

224
00:15:31,234 --> 00:15:33,434
My eyes are burning.

225
00:15:33,436 --> 00:15:35,669
Well, don't-don't blame me.
Haven't you heard?

226
00:15:35,671 --> 00:15:39,072
The mayor wants Christmas to be
three times bigger this year.

227
00:15:39,074 --> 00:15:40,974
That means
three times the lights,

228
00:15:40,976 --> 00:15:43,243
three times the eggnog,
three times the...

229
00:15:43,245 --> 00:15:46,012
Information needed.

230
00:15:46,014 --> 00:15:47,514
That's a good one.

231
00:15:47,516 --> 00:15:48,749
Oh, I get it.

232
00:15:48,751 --> 00:15:51,184
This is one of
your kidding things.

233
00:15:51,186 --> 00:15:53,086
Finally, something
you said is...

234
00:15:53,088 --> 00:15:55,221
actually funny.

235
00:15:55,223 --> 00:15:57,557
Yeah, I do kid a lot,
but no, this is actually...

236
00:15:57,559 --> 00:16:00,260
- Christmas three times bigger!
- Well, you're just gonna have

237
00:16:00,262 --> 00:16:02,228
- a good time with this, aren't you?
- Oh-ho, dear.

238
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:04,464
- Oh, no, no, no, I-I-I-I...
- I gotta say, it's really nice

239
00:16:04,466 --> 00:16:06,599
- to see you laughing.
- Sorry, I-I can't hear you.

240
00:16:06,601 --> 00:16:08,267
I don't speak ridiculous.

241
00:16:08,269 --> 00:16:10,269
Oh, you're a scream.

242
00:16:10,271 --> 00:16:12,371
- Have a nice life. Good-bye.
- I'll see you later.

243
00:16:12,373 --> 00:16:14,540
Whew! Oh, man.

244
00:16:14,542 --> 00:16:16,577
Mr. Grinch.

245
00:16:43,604 --> 00:16:46,673
I'm gonna stay awake
to see Santa!

246
00:16:55,648 --> 00:16:57,748
From the edge of his ledge,

247
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,717
way up in the sky,

248
00:16:59,719 --> 00:17:01,719
the Grinch felt upset,

249
00:17:01,721 --> 00:17:04,254
though he wasn't sure why.

250
00:17:04,256 --> 00:17:06,289
It could've been Christmas,

251
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:08,559
all that joy and the such,

252
00:17:08,561 --> 00:17:11,061
or some thoughts from his past

253
00:17:11,063 --> 00:17:13,497
that he just
couldn't quite touch.

254
00:17:13,499 --> 00:17:15,632
But whatever it was,

255
00:17:15,634 --> 00:17:17,501
it made his heart moan.

256
00:17:19,071 --> 00:17:21,304
Though he was used to it now,

257
00:17:21,306 --> 00:17:23,807
this being alone.

258
00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:26,443
And now safe in his cave,

259
00:17:26,445 --> 00:17:28,645
and apart from the fray,

260
00:17:28,647 --> 00:17:31,348
he reminded himself...

261
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:34,584
It is better this way.

262
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:48,397
That's right, yeah.

263
00:17:48,399 --> 00:17:51,634
Just right there.
No. No, not on your brother.

264
00:17:51,636 --> 00:17:53,302
Let Mommy do it.

265
00:17:56,274 --> 00:17:57,473
Whoa! Whoa...

266
00:17:57,475 --> 00:17:59,341
Cindy-Lou!

267
00:17:59,343 --> 00:18:00,543
Don't worry, Mom.

268
00:18:05,816 --> 00:18:07,348
Aah.

269
00:18:09,352 --> 00:18:11,787
I'm wearing four ski jackets.

270
00:18:11,789 --> 00:18:14,155
Four jackets?
Aren't you a little hot?

271
00:18:14,157 --> 00:18:16,491
Yep. Sweatin' a little bit.

272
00:18:16,493 --> 00:18:18,493
Are you going somewhere?

273
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:20,495
- North Pole.
- Oh. Wow.

274
00:18:20,497 --> 00:18:22,497
Any, uh, particular reason?

275
00:18:22,499 --> 00:18:24,699
- I got to talk to Santa.
- Santa, huh?

276
00:18:24,701 --> 00:18:26,901
Yeah. It's really important.

277
00:18:26,903 --> 00:18:30,438
Well, it must be if you need
to go see him in person.

278
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:33,140
- It sure is.
- Okay, then. Well, good luck,

279
00:18:33,142 --> 00:18:36,276
and I guess I'll see you
in about a month.

280
00:18:36,278 --> 00:18:40,915
Wait. It takes a whole month
to get to the North Pole?

281
00:18:40,917 --> 00:18:42,650
Oh, yeah. At least.

282
00:18:42,652 --> 00:18:44,919
Christmas will be over
by the time I got there.

283
00:18:44,921 --> 00:18:48,655
Ah, that's true. Now, we
would miss you at Christmas.

284
00:18:48,657 --> 00:18:53,160
Wow. I guess I'm gonna have
to come up with another plan.

285
00:18:53,162 --> 00:18:54,828
Hey, maybe while
you're thinking,

286
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:57,230
you could put the halo
on the angel.

287
00:18:57,232 --> 00:18:59,199
Okay.

288
00:18:59,201 --> 00:19:01,301
You want to take
your jackets off?

289
00:19:01,303 --> 00:19:03,269
Yeah, at least
one or two of them.

290
00:19:04,773 --> 00:19:07,340
No, boys, don't pull
the angel's wings off.

291
00:19:07,342 --> 00:19:09,377
She needs those.

292
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,426
So, uh...

293
00:19:27,428 --> 00:19:29,729
what do you want to do today?

294
00:19:38,205 --> 00:19:40,640
No idea, huh?

295
00:19:40,642 --> 00:19:43,575
Ooh. I got one.

296
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:52,008
All right, all right,
I'm sorry.

297
00:20:52,010 --> 00:20:53,676
You're a good dog.

298
00:20:53,678 --> 00:20:55,978
But a bad drummer.

299
00:20:57,449 --> 00:20:59,617
What would you like to do?

300
00:21:01,853 --> 00:21:05,456
More than embarrassing
to be beaten by a dog.

301
00:21:06,691 --> 00:21:08,691
Oh. What's that?

302
00:21:12,629 --> 00:21:14,763
And checkmate. Again.

303
00:21:17,735 --> 00:21:20,971
What in the world is happening?

304
00:21:39,857 --> 00:21:42,023
What is that?!

305
00:21:42,025 --> 00:21:44,358
It's the most
beautiful Christmas tree

306
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:46,360
you've ever seen!

307
00:21:46,362 --> 00:21:47,895
Three times bigger?

308
00:21:47,897 --> 00:21:50,664
Th-Th-That's
a hundred times bigger!

309
00:21:50,666 --> 00:21:53,000
Oh, you just wait
till we light it tonight.

310
00:21:53,002 --> 00:21:55,970
It'll sparkle so bright,
you'll be celebrating Christmas

311
00:21:55,972 --> 00:21:58,072
with the rest of us! Ho-ho!

312
00:21:59,509 --> 00:22:01,408
Oh, man, I can't wait!

313
00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:03,409
I'm gonna keep at it.

314
00:22:03,411 --> 00:22:05,579
- I'll see you later, Grinchy.
- No.

315
00:22:05,581 --> 00:22:07,580
You will not see me later!

316
00:22:07,582 --> 00:22:09,582
And I will not be celebrating!

317
00:22:09,584 --> 00:22:10,885
And that tree...

318
00:22:10,887 --> 00:22:13,921
that... tree...

319
00:22:13,923 --> 00:22:17,592
has got to go.

320
00:22:34,609 --> 00:22:37,442
- Come on, Mom!
- Cindy-Lou, look over there.

321
00:22:37,444 --> 00:22:40,113
- Wow! That's amazing!
- Thank you.

322
00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:43,917
Ooh, a three-eyed sock monster!

323
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:46,052
Awesome robot.

324
00:22:46,054 --> 00:22:50,455
MAYOR McGERKLE: Oh, how
marvelous this time of year is.

325
00:22:50,457 --> 00:22:55,127
Welcome, Who-ville, to the
annual tree-lighting ceremony.

326
00:22:55,129 --> 00:22:58,997
How spectacular
are these ornaments?

327
00:22:58,999 --> 00:23:01,033
Look what I made, everybody.

328
00:23:01,035 --> 00:23:03,035
It's a Christmas dragon.

329
00:23:03,037 --> 00:23:05,037
It came to me in a dream.

330
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:06,506
Oh, man.

331
00:23:08,943 --> 00:23:11,509
- Hey, Bartholomew.
- Hey there, Ms. Who.

332
00:23:11,511 --> 00:23:13,411
- Here you go.
- Got it.

333
00:23:13,413 --> 00:23:16,048
Find a good spot for it.

334
00:23:16,050 --> 00:23:17,582
There it goes.

335
00:23:29,062 --> 00:23:32,429
McGERKLE: Now, let's get ready
to flip that switch

336
00:23:32,431 --> 00:23:34,531
and light up the sky!

337
00:23:34,533 --> 00:23:36,133
Oh-ho, no.

338
00:23:36,135 --> 00:23:38,736
Not on my watch, you don't.

339
00:23:38,738 --> 00:23:40,737
See you guys soon.
Gonna go find Groopert.

340
00:23:40,739 --> 00:23:43,506
Okay. Have fun. Bye. Say "bye."

341
00:23:43,508 --> 00:23:47,044
Here you go. I hope your big
brother gets what he deserves.

342
00:23:47,046 --> 00:23:48,778
Hey, Groopert.
How's business?

343
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:50,780
Good. What I can't sell...

344
00:23:50,782 --> 00:23:52,517
I can always eat.

345
00:23:54,119 --> 00:23:57,053
I need to talk to you about
something really important.

346
00:23:57,055 --> 00:23:59,491
- Okay.
- Come on, let's go.

347
00:24:03,195 --> 00:24:06,229
All right,
check this out, Groopert.

348
00:24:06,231 --> 00:24:08,564
I'm gonna stay up
on Christmas Eve this year

349
00:24:08,566 --> 00:24:10,233
and meet Santa Claus.

350
00:24:10,235 --> 00:24:12,735
Whoa, that is crazy!

351
00:24:12,737 --> 00:24:15,171
Yeah, I really got
to talk to him.

352
00:24:15,173 --> 00:24:16,739
About what?

353
00:24:16,741 --> 00:24:18,974
Well, it's really personal.

354
00:24:18,976 --> 00:24:23,246
But I'm going to tell you,
because you're my best friend.

355
00:24:23,248 --> 00:24:25,180
It's about my mom.

356
00:24:25,182 --> 00:24:29,084
She works all night
and takes care of us all day.

357
00:24:29,086 --> 00:24:31,120
And it just isn't fair.

358
00:24:31,122 --> 00:24:34,590
She acts like she's fine...

359
00:24:34,592 --> 00:24:38,227
but I know,
it's really hard for her.

360
00:24:38,229 --> 00:24:42,865
So I figured, if anyone
could fix that, it'd be Santa.

361
00:24:42,867 --> 00:24:45,800
Wow. And I just asked him
for a turtle.

362
00:24:45,802 --> 00:24:47,802
McGERKLE: Here we go!

363
00:24:47,804 --> 00:24:51,206
- Oh. It's starting!
- Okay, Who-ville, it is time

364
00:24:51,208 --> 00:24:54,542
to light this beautiful tree.

365
00:24:54,544 --> 00:24:57,946
...17, 18, 19 and 20.

366
00:24:59,883 --> 00:25:03,219
Okay. Lock and load.

367
00:25:05,655 --> 00:25:07,789
All right,
just attach this here,

368
00:25:07,791 --> 00:25:09,791
and we'll be ready to launch.

369
00:25:13,629 --> 00:25:16,097
I know.
I wish I could see

370
00:25:16,099 --> 00:25:17,965
the look on their faces...

371
00:25:17,967 --> 00:25:20,534
Whoa!

372
00:25:20,536 --> 00:25:23,136
Oh, boy! Oh, boy! Oh, boy!
Oh, boy! Oh, boy!

373
00:25:23,138 --> 00:25:25,772
Oh, boy! Oh, boy! Hold on, hold on! Aah!

374
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:27,209
Whew! Oh, boy.

375
00:25:28,744 --> 00:25:30,879
Whoa... okay, oh, boy.

376
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:37,985
That could've been
so much worse.

377
00:25:37,987 --> 00:25:40,153
Aah...!

378
00:25:41,656 --> 00:25:43,290
Let's begin the countdown.

379
00:25:44,692 --> 00:25:47,593
Ten! Nine!

380
00:25:47,595 --> 00:25:50,163
Eight! Seven!

381
00:25:50,165 --> 00:25:51,697
Six!

382
00:25:51,699 --> 00:25:54,000
Five! Four!

383
00:25:54,002 --> 00:25:56,068
- Three! Two!
- Hey!

384
00:25:56,070 --> 00:25:57,770
My dragon can fly!

385
00:25:57,772 --> 00:25:59,805
- One!
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

386
00:26:02,143 --> 00:26:03,609
Oh, my.

387
00:26:03,611 --> 00:26:05,077
No, no, no, no. No!

388
00:26:05,079 --> 00:26:07,179
No! No! Aah!

389
00:26:17,058 --> 00:26:19,791
- Whoa!
- Wow!

390
00:26:19,793 --> 00:26:22,294
Oh, it's beautiful.

391
00:26:22,296 --> 00:26:23,828
McGERKLE:
There it is.

392
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:28,600
The most beautiful tree
Who-ville has ever seen.

393
00:26:28,602 --> 00:26:30,702
Oh, oh! No! No!

394
00:26:30,704 --> 00:26:32,137
McGERKLE: Everyone,

395
00:26:32,139 --> 00:26:34,305
have a wonderful season.

396
00:26:39,812 --> 00:26:42,213
No.

397
00:26:42,215 --> 00:26:44,215
No.

398
00:26:44,217 --> 00:26:46,251
He walked through the crowd,

399
00:26:46,253 --> 00:26:47,493
and the sound and the lights...

400
00:26:50,122 --> 00:26:53,223
...and his ears heard the thump
of their joy and delights.

401
00:26:53,225 --> 00:26:57,628
And it took him right back
to his earliest years,

402
00:26:57,630 --> 00:27:02,833
to that lost, lonely boy
who cried all of those tears.

403
00:27:02,835 --> 00:27:05,269
That lost, lonely boy,

404
00:27:05,271 --> 00:27:07,805
isolated and sad,

405
00:27:07,807 --> 00:27:10,140
with no home of his own,

406
00:27:10,142 --> 00:27:12,844
no mom and no dad.

407
00:27:18,083 --> 00:27:20,217
And as the Grinch
looked around,

408
00:27:20,219 --> 00:27:22,921
he felt downright scared...

409
00:27:24,255 --> 00:27:26,789
...as he remembered
that Christmas

410
00:27:26,791 --> 00:27:29,425
where nobody cared.

411
00:27:29,427 --> 00:27:31,894
Where nobody showed,

412
00:27:31,896 --> 00:27:34,063
not even a flea.

413
00:27:34,065 --> 00:27:36,065
And there were no cards,

414
00:27:36,067 --> 00:27:38,767
no gifts and no tree.

415
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:45,674
And as he watched other kids...

416
00:27:45,676 --> 00:27:50,313
- Woop!
- ...one thing became clear:

417
00:27:50,315 --> 00:27:54,983
that this was the single
worst day of the year.

418
00:27:57,821 --> 00:28:00,856
And now here it was,
that day once again,

419
00:28:00,858 --> 00:28:04,059
and he felt all those feelings
he felt way back when,

420
00:28:04,061 --> 00:28:06,194
when he'd watch
Whos young and old

421
00:28:06,196 --> 00:28:08,930
all sit down to feast,
and they'd feast,

422
00:28:08,932 --> 00:28:10,365
and they'd feast,

423
00:28:10,367 --> 00:28:12,766
and they'd feast,
feast, feast, feast.

424
00:28:14,037 --> 00:28:16,204
They'd feast on Who-pudding

425
00:28:16,206 --> 00:28:18,973
and rare Who roast beast.

426
00:28:18,975 --> 00:28:23,244
Which is something the Grinch
could not stand in the least.

427
00:28:23,246 --> 00:28:25,980
And then they'd do something

428
00:28:25,982 --> 00:28:28,382
he liked least of all.

429
00:28:28,384 --> 00:28:31,418
Every Who down in Who-ville,
the tall and the small,

430
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:35,022
would stand close together
with Christmas bells ringing.

431
00:28:35,024 --> 00:28:36,723
They'd stand hand in hand,

432
00:28:36,725 --> 00:28:39,393
and the Whos
would start singing.

433
00:29:00,482 --> 00:29:03,416
They'll sing, and they'll sing,

434
00:29:03,418 --> 00:29:06,986
and they'll sing,
sing, sing, sing!

435
00:29:06,988 --> 00:29:08,955
Yes, he couldn't recall

436
00:29:08,957 --> 00:29:11,424
without feeling the sting.

437
00:29:11,426 --> 00:29:14,260
So the Grinch
finally declared...

438
00:29:14,262 --> 00:29:18,132
I must stop this whole thing.

439
00:29:28,876 --> 00:29:30,209
Why?

440
00:29:30,211 --> 00:29:33,512
For 53 years,
I've put up with it.

441
00:29:33,514 --> 00:29:35,780
Now...

442
00:29:35,782 --> 00:29:40,085
I must stop this Christmas
from coming.

443
00:29:40,087 --> 00:29:41,353
But how?

444
00:29:49,363 --> 00:29:52,330
Then he got an idea.

445
00:29:52,332 --> 00:29:54,899
An awful idea.

446
00:29:54,901 --> 00:29:59,036
The Grinch got
a wonderful, awful idea.

447
00:29:59,038 --> 00:30:02,442
I know just what to do.

448
00:30:04,077 --> 00:30:08,045
I'm going to steal
their Christmas.

449
00:30:16,154 --> 00:30:18,221
All the trimmings,

450
00:30:18,223 --> 00:30:20,223
all the trappings,

451
00:30:20,225 --> 00:30:23,260
all their gifts and garlands!

452
00:30:23,262 --> 00:30:26,029
When they wake
and see it's gone,

453
00:30:26,031 --> 00:30:30,100
then all their joy and
happiness will be gone as well.

454
00:30:32,271 --> 00:30:34,371
So prepare yourself, Max.

455
00:30:34,373 --> 00:30:36,239
For tomorrow...

456
00:30:36,241 --> 00:30:39,944
We begin!

457
00:31:20,618 --> 00:31:23,318
Genius starts
with the abs, Max.

458
00:31:25,221 --> 00:31:27,522
It's go time.

459
00:31:35,598 --> 00:31:37,565
And now...

460
00:31:37,567 --> 00:31:40,934
the question we
have all been waiting for:

461
00:31:40,936 --> 00:31:43,504
How will I steal Christmas?

462
00:31:43,506 --> 00:31:48,141
Well, prepare to have
your little doggy mind blown.

463
00:31:48,143 --> 00:31:49,278
Poof.

464
00:31:59,054 --> 00:32:00,520
Ta-da!

465
00:32:00,522 --> 00:32:02,522
That's right,

466
00:32:02,524 --> 00:32:04,624
I become...

467
00:32:04,626 --> 00:32:07,227
Santa Claus.

468
00:32:07,229 --> 00:32:09,396
But instead of giving

469
00:32:09,398 --> 00:32:12,332
all the joy and happiness,
I'll take it away.

470
00:32:12,334 --> 00:32:15,602
If he can deliver Christmas to
the whole world in one night,

471
00:32:15,604 --> 00:32:20,039
then I can certainly steal it
from little old Who-ville.

472
00:32:20,041 --> 00:32:22,174
I mean, come on.

473
00:32:22,176 --> 00:32:24,944
What's Santa have that I don't?

474
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:28,280
That's hurtful.

475
00:32:28,282 --> 00:32:31,050
Um, what are you doing

476
00:32:31,052 --> 00:32:32,718
with my bowling ball?

477
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:35,187
Chasing it.

478
00:32:35,189 --> 00:32:36,522
And you're taking it where?

479
00:32:36,524 --> 00:32:38,457
- It's a secret.
- All right.

480
00:32:38,459 --> 00:32:40,393
But not without
breakfast. Catch!

481
00:32:40,395 --> 00:32:43,262
Whoa! Waffles! My favorite!

482
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:45,063
Thanks! See you guys later!

483
00:32:45,065 --> 00:32:47,600
Here we go.

484
00:32:47,602 --> 00:32:50,469
- Hey, Cindy-Lou.
- Oh, hey there, Mr. Cubbins.

485
00:32:54,141 --> 00:32:56,309
Ca-caw! Ca-caw!

486
00:32:57,645 --> 00:32:58,979
Woot, woot.

487
00:33:02,449 --> 00:33:04,551
- Ready.
- All right. Let's go.

488
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:10,055
Whoa!

489
00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:18,328
Hold on!

490
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:20,330
Whoo!

491
00:33:20,332 --> 00:33:21,668
Yeah!

492
00:33:28,507 --> 00:33:31,010
Let's go, let's go.
Let's move.

493
00:33:34,713 --> 00:33:36,613
Hang on.

494
00:33:36,615 --> 00:33:39,485
- Whoo!
- And... dismount.

495
00:33:45,724 --> 00:33:48,792
So, what do we know?

496
00:33:48,794 --> 00:33:51,127
Waffles are delicious.

497
00:33:51,129 --> 00:33:53,564
Super delicious. But I meant
about meeting Santa.

498
00:33:53,566 --> 00:33:56,265
We know no one's ever done it.

499
00:33:56,267 --> 00:33:57,366
Hmm...

500
00:33:57,368 --> 00:33:59,368
Okay. How about this?

501
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:01,370
I'm going to sit
in the living room

502
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:04,140
with my eyes wide open
like this,

503
00:34:04,142 --> 00:34:08,144
and if I start to drift off,
I'll just open them wider!

504
00:34:08,146 --> 00:34:11,112
Um, I'm pretty sure
you're gonna fall asleep.

505
00:34:11,114 --> 00:34:13,549
- And by the time you wake up...
- He'll be gone.

506
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:16,151
Nothing but cookie crumbs.

507
00:34:16,153 --> 00:34:18,153
Yeah, you're right.

508
00:34:18,155 --> 00:34:20,155
- I got it!
- Tell me!

509
00:34:20,157 --> 00:34:21,657
Maple syrup.

510
00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:23,559
All right, maple syrup.

511
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:25,795
We pour it on the roof,
the reindeer get stuck,

512
00:34:25,797 --> 00:34:27,629
and then they can't fly away.

513
00:34:27,631 --> 00:34:28,798
Science!

514
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,665
Won't the syrup just freeze?

515
00:34:30,667 --> 00:34:32,434
- Good point.
- Also, how do we get

516
00:34:32,436 --> 00:34:34,302
all that syrup on the roof?

517
00:34:34,304 --> 00:34:35,770
Yeah, I got nothing.

518
00:34:38,575 --> 00:34:40,275
Wait a minute.

519
00:34:40,277 --> 00:34:43,177
- I think I got it.
- What?

520
00:34:43,179 --> 00:34:46,681
We're gonna need
the whole gang for this one.

521
00:34:46,683 --> 00:34:48,115
Okay.

522
00:34:48,117 --> 00:34:49,518
If I'm going to become Santa,

523
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:52,654
then I need to get
into character.

524
00:34:54,357 --> 00:34:56,357
All right, let's see.

525
00:34:56,359 --> 00:34:57,358
"Christmas Tree."

526
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:58,492
"Christmas Traditions."

527
00:34:58,494 --> 00:34:59,861
"Christmas Pudding."

528
00:34:59,863 --> 00:35:02,096
How does pudding work its way
into everything?

529
00:35:02,098 --> 00:35:04,098
Where is the Santa stuff?

530
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:06,700
Look at this.
Little girls and boys giggling

531
00:35:06,702 --> 00:35:08,469
over sugarplums.

532
00:35:08,471 --> 00:35:09,603
Oh.

533
00:35:09,605 --> 00:35:11,305
Look how they did the roof

534
00:35:11,307 --> 00:35:14,375
of the gingerbread house
with vanilla icing.

535
00:35:14,377 --> 00:35:17,245
Little... family of gumdrops.

536
00:35:20,415 --> 00:35:21,749
So dumb.

537
00:35:21,751 --> 00:35:23,485
So, so stupidly dumb.

538
00:35:24,519 --> 00:35:25,786
Ah, here we are.

539
00:35:25,788 --> 00:35:27,554
"The Legend of Santa Claus."

540
00:35:27,556 --> 00:35:29,522
Red suit, white beard,

541
00:35:29,524 --> 00:35:31,858
always in a jolly mood.

542
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:34,427
Oh. That's not gonna happen.

543
00:35:34,429 --> 00:35:36,229
Oh, well.
Let's just start

544
00:35:36,231 --> 00:35:38,733
by finding ourselves
some reindeer.

545
00:35:46,875 --> 00:35:49,274
Beautiful.
Isn't it, Max?

546
00:35:49,276 --> 00:35:51,176
This, my little friend,

547
00:35:51,178 --> 00:35:53,412
is the Rein-Horn.

548
00:35:53,414 --> 00:35:56,682
It perfectly re-creates the
mating call of the reindeer.

549
00:35:56,684 --> 00:35:58,450
Behold.

550
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,460
Oh. Hey there.

551
00:36:08,462 --> 00:36:10,862
Sorry, little goat.
I was calling for a rein...

552
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:14,900
What was that?!

553
00:36:14,902 --> 00:36:16,802
Scram! Skedaddle!

554
00:36:16,804 --> 00:36:18,804
Strange goat.

555
00:36:20,239 --> 00:36:22,406
Now, reindeer migrate,

556
00:36:22,408 --> 00:36:25,409
so maybe we'll catch a few
headed south for the winter.

557
00:36:25,411 --> 00:36:27,678
I also read that they tend
to mate in densely wooded...

558
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:30,781
Will you stop following us?!

559
00:36:30,783 --> 00:36:33,284
Shoo! Away! Go back to the goat farm.

560
00:36:33,286 --> 00:36:34,819
Go eat a can.

561
00:36:37,557 --> 00:36:40,558
All right, now that that's
over, back to the task at hand.

562
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:43,894
Whew! It's a little crisp.

563
00:36:43,896 --> 00:36:46,296
Oh, it's getting...

564
00:36:46,298 --> 00:36:48,499
really... c-cold.

565
00:36:48,501 --> 00:36:51,301
Oh, goodness!

566
00:36:51,303 --> 00:36:52,737
Can't...

567
00:36:52,739 --> 00:36:54,939
feel my lips.

568
00:36:54,941 --> 00:36:56,941
Can't... blink.

569
00:36:56,943 --> 00:36:59,476
Eyes... frozen!

570
00:37:02,982 --> 00:37:04,547
Max...

571
00:37:04,549 --> 00:37:08,318
we've hit the mother lode.

572
00:37:09,354 --> 00:37:11,488
We'll have 100 reindeer

573
00:37:11,490 --> 00:37:14,791
to pull our...

574
00:37:25,703 --> 00:37:27,805
Huh?

575
00:37:31,809 --> 00:37:33,742
Well, Santa had eight.

576
00:37:33,744 --> 00:37:36,512
He looks like he ate
the other seven.

577
00:37:37,648 --> 00:37:39,950
Watch and learn, Max.

578
00:37:41,318 --> 00:37:42,720
All right.

579
00:38:06,443 --> 00:38:07,975
Aah!

580
00:38:09,546 --> 00:38:10,778
Uh-oh.

581
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:11,815
Aah!

582
00:38:12,849 --> 00:38:13,950
Aah!

583
00:38:25,895 --> 00:38:27,627
Aah! Frozen, stinkin'...

584
00:38:27,629 --> 00:38:29,429
Stop. Stop.

585
00:38:30,933 --> 00:38:33,667
Onward, my furry friends.

586
00:38:33,669 --> 00:38:37,404
We're walking toward destiny.

587
00:38:44,446 --> 00:38:46,949
- Let's get in there!
- Whoo-hoo!

588
00:38:48,516 --> 00:38:50,784
All right, you called, we came.

589
00:38:50,786 --> 00:38:53,019
- So what's up?
- Yeah, what's the deal?

590
00:38:53,021 --> 00:38:55,021
Thanks for getting here
so fast, guys.

591
00:38:55,023 --> 00:38:56,892
Follow me.

592
00:38:58,593 --> 00:39:00,693
So, what's the big secret?

593
00:39:00,695 --> 00:39:03,796
Yeah, I don't have very long.
My parents set the timer.

594
00:39:03,798 --> 00:39:06,632
- Dude.
- Don't ask. It's new.

595
00:39:06,634 --> 00:39:09,468
All right, everybody,
brace yourselves.

596
00:39:09,470 --> 00:39:11,937
In exactly 48 hours,

597
00:39:11,939 --> 00:39:16,542
we are going to do something
that's never been done before.

598
00:39:16,544 --> 00:39:18,476
We're gonna...

599
00:39:18,478 --> 00:39:20,813
trap Santa Claus!

600
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:29,521
Trap Santa?
Why would we want to do that?

601
00:39:29,523 --> 00:39:31,689
Duh. To steal all his toys.
I love it.

602
00:39:31,691 --> 00:39:33,125
- Oh, yeah!
- That's a great idea!

603
00:39:33,127 --> 00:39:35,393
No, not to steal his toys.

604
00:39:35,395 --> 00:39:37,629
To, um, to talk to him.

605
00:39:37,631 --> 00:39:40,832
- What? Why do you want to talk to him?
- It's personal.

606
00:39:40,834 --> 00:39:43,568
- Yeah, it's kind of personal.
- Well, I don't want

607
00:39:43,570 --> 00:39:45,435
to do it if you
won't tell me why.

608
00:39:45,437 --> 00:39:47,437
- What are you talking about, "personal"?
- Axl,

609
00:39:47,439 --> 00:39:50,108
when you asked to borrow $16
and my mom's suitcase,

610
00:39:50,110 --> 00:39:52,143
did I ask you why?

611
00:39:52,145 --> 00:39:54,511
- No.
- And what about you, Ozzy?

612
00:39:54,513 --> 00:39:56,413
Remember when you
got stuck in that...

613
00:39:56,415 --> 00:39:58,016
All right, all right, okay.
Geez.

614
00:39:58,018 --> 00:40:00,151
I did it
because you're my friend,

615
00:40:00,153 --> 00:40:01,952
and when something
matters to you,

616
00:40:01,954 --> 00:40:04,089
that means it matters to me.

617
00:40:05,624 --> 00:40:07,891
- That's beautiful.
- Okay, okay, okay.

618
00:40:07,893 --> 00:40:09,493
You convinced me.

619
00:40:09,495 --> 00:40:11,628
- Count me in, too.
- All right, we're in.

620
00:40:11,630 --> 00:40:13,797
- Great! Now, let's do this.
- Yeah, let's do this!

621
00:40:13,799 --> 00:40:15,032
- Oh, yeah! Awesome!
- Let's make it happen.

622
00:40:15,034 --> 00:40:16,432
Whoa, cool.
That is so cool.

623
00:40:16,434 --> 00:40:18,869
- To the bikes!
- Yeah!

624
00:40:25,577 --> 00:40:27,710
- Cindy-Lou! Dinnertime!
- Let's go, guys! Dinnertime!

625
00:40:27,712 --> 00:40:29,412
- Time to eat!
- Ooh, dinner.

626
00:40:29,414 --> 00:40:31,148
All right, we meet
first thing in the morning.

627
00:40:31,150 --> 00:40:32,748
- Okay.
- All right, see you tomorrow.

628
00:40:32,750 --> 00:40:35,017
- See you guys in the morning.
- Ozzy! Timer!

629
00:40:35,019 --> 00:40:36,953
Okay, Mom.

630
00:40:51,836 --> 00:40:53,970
This is the loudest snow

631
00:40:53,972 --> 00:40:56,438
I've ever heard in my life.

632
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:58,473
You two, go around the back.

633
00:40:58,475 --> 00:41:01,877
Wait for me to drop
the sleigh from the roof. Okay?

634
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:05,780
Go, team.

635
00:41:19,129 --> 00:41:20,130
Ah-ah-ah-ah.

636
00:41:28,671 --> 00:41:29,671
Shh.

637
00:41:35,544 --> 00:41:37,912
Aah!

638
00:41:37,914 --> 00:41:38,981
Aah!

639
00:41:45,988 --> 00:41:47,121
Whew!

640
00:41:53,561 --> 00:41:55,162
Aah!

641
00:41:55,164 --> 00:41:56,829
Aah...!

642
00:42:04,839 --> 00:42:07,106
What? Wha-What's going on?

643
00:42:07,108 --> 00:42:09,575
Hey. Who taught Mabel

644
00:42:09,577 --> 00:42:11,210
how to use the doorbell?

645
00:42:11,212 --> 00:42:12,712
Man, that's awesome.

646
00:42:12,714 --> 00:42:14,783
You smart little dog.

647
00:42:25,093 --> 00:42:28,660
Huh? What's this?

648
00:42:52,585 --> 00:42:56,056
All right, here it comes.
Get ready.

649
00:43:06,599 --> 00:43:07,832
Aah!

650
00:43:10,036 --> 00:43:11,802
You tell...

651
00:43:11,804 --> 00:43:13,304
What? Oh!

652
00:43:13,306 --> 00:43:15,840
Oh, look at that.
Mabel is delivering cakes now.

653
00:43:15,842 --> 00:43:18,342
I mean, is this
the best Christmas, or what?

654
00:43:18,344 --> 00:43:20,845
Oh... whoa!

655
00:43:20,847 --> 00:43:23,813
Whoa...!

656
00:43:29,155 --> 00:43:32,122
Oh! Holy moly!

657
00:43:34,092 --> 00:43:36,126
Man, I don't know
what's in this cake,

658
00:43:36,128 --> 00:43:38,128
but I think I just saw
Santa Claus.

659
00:43:38,130 --> 00:43:40,632
Let me get another piece.

660
00:43:45,070 --> 00:43:47,170
Today was great.

661
00:43:47,172 --> 00:43:49,372
We did mean things,

662
00:43:49,374 --> 00:43:52,208
and we did them in style.

663
00:43:52,210 --> 00:43:56,012
Max, you know the rules.

664
00:43:56,014 --> 00:43:57,646
You sleep in your bed,

665
00:43:57,648 --> 00:44:00,015
and I sleep in...

666
00:44:00,017 --> 00:44:02,918
Oh, no, no, not you, too.
I don't believe this.

667
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:05,254
Max, did you teach him
puppy eyes?

668
00:44:11,962 --> 00:44:13,228
Fine.

669
00:44:13,230 --> 00:44:15,230
This one time.

670
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:31,813
Ah...

671
00:44:31,815 --> 00:44:33,714
Ah.

672
00:45:36,878 --> 00:45:40,746
Mmm! Now, that is
a great cup of coffee.

673
00:45:44,485 --> 00:45:48,187
Max, this morning, you and I
need to do some recon.

674
00:45:48,189 --> 00:45:50,755
Fred, you just sit right there.

675
00:45:50,757 --> 00:45:52,258
And don't touch anything.

676
00:45:54,128 --> 00:45:56,162
Intel, Max,
that's what we're after.

677
00:45:56,164 --> 00:45:58,029
How many houses are
in Who-ville,

678
00:45:58,031 --> 00:45:59,431
and how many Whos?

679
00:45:59,433 --> 00:46:02,967
How many wreaths and trees
and chimney flues?

680
00:46:02,969 --> 00:46:05,236
I'll be in your ear
the whole time,

681
00:46:05,238 --> 00:46:06,371
and whatever you're seeing,

682
00:46:06,373 --> 00:46:08,806
I'll be seeing on the monitor.

683
00:46:08,808 --> 00:46:10,408
Ready? Now, off you go, Max.

684
00:46:10,410 --> 00:46:12,377
Fly, boy.

685
00:46:12,379 --> 00:46:14,078
Fly!

686
00:46:22,355 --> 00:46:25,490
Max, stop socializing.

687
00:46:25,492 --> 00:46:29,061
Now, let's go in for a look.

688
00:46:30,397 --> 00:46:32,963
Okay, six houses on Oak Street.

689
00:46:32,965 --> 00:46:34,131
Oh, watch out!

690
00:46:34,133 --> 00:46:35,933
Wha...?

691
00:46:35,935 --> 00:46:39,203
- Huh.
- Okay, go. Go, go, go.

692
00:46:39,205 --> 00:46:41,471
Now, cut through Main Street
and survey the south side.

693
00:46:41,473 --> 00:46:43,173
Merry Christmas!

694
00:46:43,175 --> 00:46:45,309
Look at those
greedy little gift monsters,

695
00:46:45,311 --> 00:46:48,811
loading themselves up
with Christmas junk.

696
00:46:48,813 --> 00:46:51,215
- Okay, Max, turn right here.
- Whoa!

697
00:46:51,217 --> 00:46:53,816
So I woke up this morning,
got dressed, had my coffee,

698
00:46:53,818 --> 00:46:55,252
went outside,
looked on the roof.

699
00:46:55,254 --> 00:46:56,953
My sleigh was gone.

700
00:46:56,955 --> 00:46:58,955
My, my, I wonder who took it.

701
00:47:00,392 --> 00:47:02,426
Okay, let's see here.
If we do...

702
00:47:02,428 --> 00:47:04,026
28 houses an hour

703
00:47:04,028 --> 00:47:06,563
for six hours,
that would be sausages.

704
00:47:06,565 --> 00:47:07,930
Sausages?!

705
00:47:07,932 --> 00:47:10,969
Max! Don't even think about it.

706
00:47:14,472 --> 00:47:15,473
Max!

707
00:47:19,077 --> 00:47:20,276
Max, are you okay?

708
00:47:20,278 --> 00:47:21,910
Max?

709
00:47:21,912 --> 00:47:23,212
Oh, hey, look, it's me.

710
00:47:23,214 --> 00:47:25,248
Oh, dear. Aah!

711
00:47:25,250 --> 00:47:27,882
Bad dog.

712
00:47:27,884 --> 00:47:30,421
Fred, we're home!

713
00:47:31,422 --> 00:47:33,855
Fred...?

714
00:47:33,857 --> 00:47:36,224
What are you... doing?

715
00:47:40,897 --> 00:47:42,230
Okay.

716
00:47:42,232 --> 00:47:44,334
Come on, we got work to do.

717
00:47:46,570 --> 00:47:49,106
Now, let's plan our route.

718
00:47:51,275 --> 00:47:53,575
First, now, we go south,
quick jaunt to the east,

719
00:47:53,577 --> 00:47:56,478
and then this house, skip
the subdivision for the moment,

720
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:59,381
knock off the entire
southeast quadrant of the town,

721
00:47:59,383 --> 00:48:01,616
and then we finish it all up...

722
00:48:01,618 --> 00:48:04,385
on Whistling Who Lane.

723
00:48:04,387 --> 00:48:06,920
That's 223 houses

724
00:48:06,922 --> 00:48:09,490
and only seven hours
of darkness to work with.

725
00:48:09,492 --> 00:48:13,327
That means we have to be
fast and focused.

726
00:48:13,329 --> 00:48:17,031
And believe you me,
there will be temptation...

727
00:48:17,033 --> 00:48:19,133
all around us.

728
00:48:23,439 --> 00:48:25,306
Behold! The present.

729
00:48:25,308 --> 00:48:27,374
This is our enemy.

730
00:48:27,376 --> 00:48:29,942
You will want to unwrap it.

731
00:48:29,944 --> 00:48:33,379
And... play with it.

732
00:48:36,484 --> 00:48:39,185
But you must not!

733
00:48:39,187 --> 00:48:41,287
And if you can get past
the present,

734
00:48:41,289 --> 00:48:43,525
the only obstacle left is...

735
00:48:45,226 --> 00:48:47,894
...the cookie.

736
00:48:47,896 --> 00:48:50,496
Look at it in all
its red, sugary splendor.

737
00:48:51,899 --> 00:48:53,633
No, no, no.
Look at yourselves.

738
00:48:53,635 --> 00:48:55,603
Discipline. We must...

739
00:48:59,106 --> 00:49:01,474
...resist.

740
00:49:01,476 --> 00:49:04,309
- Are you ready?
- Almost.

741
00:49:04,311 --> 00:49:06,178
Good. Think jolly.

742
00:49:06,180 --> 00:49:08,547
- And fat.
- Okay, I'm ready.

743
00:49:08,549 --> 00:49:10,317
All right, quick.
Everybody, hide.

744
00:49:11,352 --> 00:49:13,118
Three, two, one,

745
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:14,386
cue Santa!

746
00:49:14,388 --> 00:49:17,089
That means you, Groopert.

747
00:49:21,195 --> 00:49:24,463
Ho, ho, ho, ho.
Look at this pretty house.

748
00:49:24,465 --> 00:49:26,631
I will leave presents
for the people.

749
00:49:26,633 --> 00:49:28,567
Come on, it's not
the school play, dude.

750
00:49:28,569 --> 00:49:31,335
- Then why do I have to wear the outfit?
- Groopert!

751
00:49:31,337 --> 00:49:33,170
Focus. Just get the cookie!

752
00:49:33,172 --> 00:49:35,540
But I can see the strings.

753
00:49:35,542 --> 00:49:37,642
Stop worrying.
It'll be dark at night.

754
00:49:37,644 --> 00:49:39,543
What if he has a flashlight?

755
00:49:39,545 --> 00:49:41,712
Have you ever seen a picture
of Santa with a flashlight?

756
00:49:41,714 --> 00:49:43,514
- No, but I just...
- Groopert,

757
00:49:43,516 --> 00:49:45,282
just pick up the cookie!

758
00:49:45,284 --> 00:49:48,119
Hmm. What do we have here?

759
00:49:48,121 --> 00:49:50,922
A delicious little cookie.

760
00:49:53,126 --> 00:49:54,291
Aah!

761
00:49:54,293 --> 00:49:56,329
Groopert!

762
00:49:57,963 --> 00:49:59,095
Groopert?

763
00:49:59,097 --> 00:50:01,131
Uh, hey, guys.

764
00:50:01,133 --> 00:50:04,602
Do I still get to eat
the cookie?

765
00:50:07,607 --> 00:50:12,976
All right, so I tinkered
with our sleigh a bit.

766
00:50:12,978 --> 00:50:14,446
Behold!

767
00:50:25,122 --> 00:50:26,489
Look at this, Max.

768
00:50:26,491 --> 00:50:29,024
Now you'll be riding in style.

769
00:50:29,026 --> 00:50:31,293
A throne for a barking prince.

770
00:50:31,295 --> 00:50:32,762
How do you like that?

771
00:50:34,498 --> 00:50:37,099
All right, Fred,
you are the engine

772
00:50:37,101 --> 00:50:38,567
of this great machine.

773
00:50:38,569 --> 00:50:39,769
Understood?

774
00:50:39,771 --> 00:50:41,703
Good.

775
00:50:41,705 --> 00:50:44,239
Now, remember,
this is just a practice run,

776
00:50:44,241 --> 00:50:46,375
but on this team
we practice like we play.

777
00:50:46,377 --> 00:50:49,146
So let's leave it all
out on the snow.

778
00:50:51,515 --> 00:50:54,416
Oh! Okay!

779
00:50:54,418 --> 00:50:58,219
All right, how about that?

780
00:50:58,221 --> 00:51:01,222
Now, let's pick up the pace
and see how she handles.

781
00:51:01,224 --> 00:51:02,691
Oh, ho-ho!

782
00:51:05,663 --> 00:51:08,196
Hang on!

783
00:51:08,198 --> 00:51:10,631
No, no, no. No problem.

784
00:51:10,633 --> 00:51:12,569
It's all... under control.

785
00:51:16,139 --> 00:51:17,207
Whoa!

786
00:51:19,075 --> 00:51:20,374
Aah!

787
00:51:25,248 --> 00:51:26,248
Aah!

788
00:51:32,454 --> 00:51:34,822
We're doing it, Max.
We are doing it!

789
00:51:34,824 --> 00:51:37,125
We will not be...

790
00:51:38,627 --> 00:51:40,560
...stopped?

791
00:51:40,562 --> 00:51:42,729
What happened? Fred?

792
00:51:42,731 --> 00:51:45,699
Oh, um...

793
00:51:45,701 --> 00:51:48,435
sorry, but we don't need
any more reindeer.

794
00:51:48,437 --> 00:51:50,770
No. Go. Get. Shoo.

795
00:51:50,772 --> 00:51:52,539
I have what I need.

796
00:52:11,526 --> 00:52:13,728
It's okay, Fred.

797
00:52:33,179 --> 00:52:35,881
On our own again, Max.

798
00:52:41,421 --> 00:52:44,289
It was the day
before Christmas,

799
00:52:44,291 --> 00:52:46,357
and the Whos were abuzz,

800
00:52:46,359 --> 00:52:49,561
all doing the things
that a Christmas Who does.

801
00:52:51,431 --> 00:52:55,198
Some were out buying presents,
others just milled about.

802
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:57,802
- There you go, sir.
- But the whole town felt joyous,

803
00:52:57,804 --> 00:52:59,904
of that there was no doubt.

804
00:52:59,906 --> 00:53:04,308
The weather was perfect,
and soon snow would fall.

805
00:53:04,310 --> 00:53:05,877
- This surely would be...
- All right, everyone ready?

806
00:53:05,879 --> 00:53:08,880
...the best Christmas of all.

807
00:53:20,359 --> 00:53:22,292
Max! There you are.

808
00:53:22,294 --> 00:53:23,694
Check this out.

809
00:53:23,696 --> 00:53:25,429
Whoa! Ah.

810
00:53:25,431 --> 00:53:27,931
I've been making
lots of cool... Whoa!

811
00:53:27,933 --> 00:53:30,801
...stuff!

812
00:53:30,803 --> 00:53:32,535
Ooh, more coffee.

813
00:53:34,238 --> 00:53:36,773
It's gonna be a big night.

814
00:53:36,775 --> 00:53:38,875
We got all the gizmos
and gazmos we need,

815
00:53:38,877 --> 00:53:41,444
but we still don't have
the proper outfit.

816
00:53:41,446 --> 00:53:44,547
Come on, let's do
a little stitching.

817
00:54:08,639 --> 00:54:11,306
There's only one thing
left to do.

818
00:54:14,511 --> 00:54:16,311
Max?

819
00:54:16,313 --> 00:54:18,313
Do you know what you are?

820
00:54:18,315 --> 00:54:20,915
You are a sturdy little fella.

821
00:54:22,419 --> 00:54:24,319
And loyal.

822
00:54:24,321 --> 00:54:25,687
Very loyal.

823
00:54:25,689 --> 00:54:29,456
In fact, I think
you're the best dog

824
00:54:29,458 --> 00:54:31,826
a Grinch could hope for.

825
00:54:31,828 --> 00:54:33,862
And that is why...

826
00:54:33,864 --> 00:54:36,397
I'm promoting you.

827
00:54:38,300 --> 00:54:39,901
Max...

828
00:54:39,903 --> 00:54:43,539
you will guide
my sleigh tonight.

829
00:54:49,412 --> 00:54:50,878
Ha-ha!

830
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:53,582
I knew you
wouldn't let me down.

831
00:54:58,521 --> 00:55:00,654
It was now Christmas Eve.

832
00:55:00,656 --> 00:55:02,690
There was joy in the air.

833
00:55:02,692 --> 00:55:06,693
For in just a few hours,
Santa Claus would be there.

834
00:55:06,695 --> 00:55:10,630
And the gifts would be left,
and the stockings all filled.

835
00:55:10,632 --> 00:55:12,632
And the anticipation,

836
00:55:12,634 --> 00:55:15,902
well, it started to build.

837
00:55:15,904 --> 00:55:17,904
Ozzy, what are you doing?

838
00:55:17,906 --> 00:55:20,273
Trying... to get...
myself tired.

839
00:55:21,743 --> 00:55:24,043
All right, eight hours
till Christmas morning.

840
00:55:24,045 --> 00:55:26,579
That's 28,800 seconds.

841
00:55:26,581 --> 00:55:29,015
Okay, and... sleep!

842
00:55:29,017 --> 00:55:31,017
Waffle One, this is Waffle Two.

843
00:55:31,019 --> 00:55:32,852
Are you there? Over.

844
00:55:32,854 --> 00:55:35,520
I read
you loud and clear, Waffle Two.

845
00:55:35,522 --> 00:55:38,057
- This is Groopert, by the way.
- Yeah, I got that.

846
00:55:38,059 --> 00:55:40,927
Oh. I just wanted
to wish you good luck

847
00:55:40,929 --> 00:55:44,496
- with Santa Claus.
- Thanks. Talk tomorrow.

848
00:55:44,498 --> 00:55:48,433
So, you got any
last-minute wishes for Santa?

849
00:55:48,435 --> 00:55:51,002
Yep. I have one great big wish.

850
00:55:51,004 --> 00:55:54,806
Good. Because you deserve
everything you want and more.

851
00:55:54,808 --> 00:55:56,508
Thanks, Mom.

852
00:55:56,510 --> 00:55:58,944
I want the same thing for you.

853
00:55:58,946 --> 00:56:02,948
How did I end up
with such a wonderful daughter?

854
00:56:02,950 --> 00:56:05,083
I don't know.
Sometimes you just get lucky.

855
00:56:05,085 --> 00:56:06,918
Well, then I really did.

856
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:08,486
Me, too.

857
00:56:08,488 --> 00:56:09,888
I love you, Mom.

858
00:56:09,890 --> 00:56:11,858
I love you, sweetheart.

859
00:56:12,925 --> 00:56:15,261
- Good night.
- Good night.

860
00:56:37,449 --> 00:56:41,584
The Grinch was now
ready to start his big trip.

861
00:56:41,586 --> 00:56:44,654
He stood like a captain
aboard a great ship.

862
00:56:44,656 --> 00:56:48,625
Yes, the time had now come
to take off like a shot.

863
00:56:48,627 --> 00:56:50,059
Here we go, Max.

864
00:56:50,061 --> 00:56:52,762
Let's see what you've got!

865
00:56:52,764 --> 00:56:55,000
Hyah!

866
00:56:58,469 --> 00:56:59,969
What?

867
00:56:59,971 --> 00:57:02,471
Max?

868
00:57:02,473 --> 00:57:04,009
Max, are you okay?

869
00:57:05,043 --> 00:57:06,377
Huh?

870
00:57:13,484 --> 00:57:14,983
Yeah, Max!

871
00:57:14,985 --> 00:57:16,418
Attaboy!

872
00:57:16,420 --> 00:57:17,686
Go, boy! Go!

873
00:57:19,423 --> 00:57:21,623
And down the Grinch came

874
00:57:21,625 --> 00:57:24,059
on his great fateful ride,

875
00:57:24,061 --> 00:57:26,695
toward the good homes
of Who-ville

876
00:57:26,697 --> 00:57:29,430
and the Christmas inside.

877
00:57:36,706 --> 00:57:39,540
He had planned it
and prepped it,

878
00:57:39,542 --> 00:57:41,344
big detail to small.

879
00:57:43,479 --> 00:57:45,980
Yes, he'd get rid
of Christmas now,

880
00:57:45,982 --> 00:57:48,482
once and for all.

881
00:57:48,484 --> 00:57:51,487
You take the outside,
I'll take the inside.

882
00:57:58,928 --> 00:58:01,130
House number one.

883
00:58:17,012 --> 00:58:19,012
He was ready to pounce

884
00:58:19,014 --> 00:58:21,147
and set the score right.

885
00:58:21,149 --> 00:58:24,684
He'd make up for the past,
and he'd do it tonight.

886
00:58:24,686 --> 00:58:25,886
Okay...

887
00:58:25,888 --> 00:58:28,054
now, let's steal Christmas.

888
00:58:29,590 --> 00:58:31,523
He swept up their presents

889
00:58:31,525 --> 00:58:33,093
with the speed of a wiz.

890
00:58:33,095 --> 00:58:35,929
And he knew he'd cause sadness.

891
00:58:35,931 --> 00:58:39,101
Only theirs now, not his.

892
00:59:16,903 --> 00:59:18,937
All this excess and nonsense,

893
00:59:18,939 --> 00:59:20,705
it was all about greed.

894
00:59:20,707 --> 00:59:22,273
About meaningless stuff

895
00:59:22,275 --> 00:59:25,009
that they didn't even need.

896
00:59:25,011 --> 00:59:26,713
Yeah.

897
00:59:33,119 --> 00:59:35,086
The Grinch went to work.

898
00:59:35,088 --> 00:59:36,254
He scooped up the toys.

899
00:59:36,256 --> 00:59:41,827
He raced against time.
He raced against joy.

900
00:59:45,831 --> 00:59:47,698
He hit a few snags

901
00:59:47,700 --> 00:59:49,700
as he made his way through.

902
00:59:49,702 --> 00:59:53,003
An angry orange cat...

903
00:59:53,005 --> 00:59:54,938
and a sleepwalking Who.

904
00:59:56,275 --> 00:59:57,540
Huh?

905
01:00:02,815 --> 01:00:04,716
Thank you, Mommy.

906
01:00:06,085 --> 01:00:07,850
He stole pop guns and bicycles,

907
01:00:07,852 --> 01:00:09,585
roller skates, drums,

908
01:00:09,587 --> 01:00:12,855
checker boards, tricycles,
popcorn and plums.

909
01:00:14,726 --> 01:00:18,094
Gadgets and gizmos,
and dolls with strange names,

910
01:00:18,096 --> 01:00:21,764
goofballs and shloof-balls
and video games.

911
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:52,227
And he swiped and he poached.

912
01:00:52,229 --> 01:00:54,829
Yes, the stealing was on.

913
01:00:54,831 --> 01:00:57,065
And this day that he hated,

914
01:00:57,067 --> 01:01:00,636
well, he made it be gone.

915
01:01:05,075 --> 01:01:08,111
This is it, the last house.

916
01:01:29,999 --> 01:01:31,832
Ha!

917
01:01:38,006 --> 01:01:39,239
Huh?

918
01:01:41,776 --> 01:01:43,144
Oh, what the heck?

919
01:01:44,380 --> 01:01:46,179
Ah.

920
01:01:46,181 --> 01:01:47,280
Huh?

921
01:01:49,350 --> 01:01:51,651
He's here!

922
01:01:51,653 --> 01:01:53,088
Whoa. What the...?

923
01:01:54,756 --> 01:01:57,656
Aah! Whoa. Whoa! Aah!

924
01:02:07,268 --> 01:02:09,170
How do I get out of this?

925
01:02:10,205 --> 01:02:13,272
Santa Claus.

926
01:02:13,274 --> 01:02:15,073
Oh. Uh, hello.

927
01:02:15,075 --> 01:02:17,075
A little help, please?

928
01:02:17,077 --> 01:02:18,777
I'll let you down.
Just give me a minute.

929
01:02:18,779 --> 01:02:20,846
Oh, that would be great.

930
01:02:20,848 --> 01:02:23,148
I'm coming.
Just trying to remember...

931
01:02:23,150 --> 01:02:25,150
which cord it is.

932
01:02:25,152 --> 01:02:26,318
Oh, no!

933
01:02:26,320 --> 01:02:27,886
I'm so sorry.

934
01:02:27,888 --> 01:02:29,154
Are you okay?

935
01:02:29,156 --> 01:02:31,389
Yeah. I-I guess so.

936
01:02:31,391 --> 01:02:34,326
Let me help you.

937
01:02:34,328 --> 01:02:37,095
Sit down here.

938
01:02:37,097 --> 01:02:39,264
- Whew.
- Drink this.

939
01:02:39,266 --> 01:02:42,467
It'll make you feel better.

940
01:02:42,469 --> 01:02:44,704
Uh... thanks.

941
01:02:46,706 --> 01:02:49,874
Wow. I can't believe
it's really you.

942
01:02:49,876 --> 01:02:51,742
Uh... yeah.

943
01:02:51,744 --> 01:02:54,311
I'm so sorry about the trap
and everything,

944
01:02:54,313 --> 01:02:56,013
but I really need...

945
01:02:56,015 --> 01:02:58,351
Hey. Why are you taking
our Christmas tree?

946
01:03:00,286 --> 01:03:01,784
Well...

947
01:03:01,786 --> 01:03:03,853
uh, one of the lights
wasn't working,

948
01:03:03,855 --> 01:03:06,490
so I thought I'd
take it back to the workshop

949
01:03:06,492 --> 01:03:09,126
and see if I could fix it.

950
01:03:09,128 --> 01:03:10,994
I didn't know you did that.

951
01:03:10,996 --> 01:03:12,496
Yeah. Sure.

952
01:03:12,498 --> 01:03:15,332
Now, why don't you
go back upstairs to bed,

953
01:03:15,334 --> 01:03:17,333
and then when you wake up,
the tree will be fixed

954
01:03:17,335 --> 01:03:19,102
- and your presents will be waiting under it.
- Wait.

955
01:03:19,104 --> 01:03:21,004
You don't understand.
I don't want presents.

956
01:03:21,006 --> 01:03:23,840
Of course you do.
Everyone wants presents.

957
01:03:23,842 --> 01:03:27,377
No, no, really, I don't.
I want you to help my mom.

958
01:03:27,379 --> 01:03:29,212
Y-Your mom?

959
01:03:29,214 --> 01:03:32,215
Yeah. She works so hard

960
01:03:32,217 --> 01:03:35,185
and is always doing stuff
for other people.

961
01:03:35,187 --> 01:03:38,288
And I just want her
to be happy.

962
01:03:38,290 --> 01:03:40,989
You want me to help...
your mom?

963
01:03:40,991 --> 01:03:42,991
You're Santa.

964
01:03:42,993 --> 01:03:44,993
You make people happy.

965
01:03:44,995 --> 01:03:49,064
And everyone
should be happy, right?

966
01:03:49,066 --> 01:03:51,333
Y-Yeah, I...

967
01:03:51,335 --> 01:03:54,102
I guess they should.

968
01:03:54,104 --> 01:03:55,437
Santa,

969
01:03:55,439 --> 01:03:58,040
are... are you okay?

970
01:03:58,042 --> 01:03:59,041
What?

971
01:03:59,043 --> 01:04:01,410
Uh... yeah. I'm fine.

972
01:04:03,047 --> 01:04:05,414
Now, why don't you go
back up to bed, hmm?

973
01:04:05,416 --> 01:04:07,349
Okay.

974
01:04:07,351 --> 01:04:10,117
I wish you could celebrate
with us tomorrow.

975
01:04:10,119 --> 01:04:12,421
We all get together and sing.

976
01:04:12,423 --> 01:04:15,122
It's so beautiful that

977
01:04:15,124 --> 01:04:18,359
if you close your eyes
and listen,

978
01:04:18,361 --> 01:04:21,965
all of your sadness
just goes away.

979
01:04:25,435 --> 01:04:28,135
That sounds nice.

980
01:04:29,239 --> 01:04:30,438
Huh?

981
01:04:34,977 --> 01:04:37,278
Thank you, Santa.

982
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:39,282
Good night.

983
01:04:42,084 --> 01:04:44,119
Good-good night.

984
01:04:57,266 --> 01:05:00,969
I just met
the strangest little Who girl.

985
01:05:05,940 --> 01:05:08,508
All right, Max. Let's go.

986
01:05:12,547 --> 01:05:16,315
He tried to forget it,
but the words filled his head,

987
01:05:16,317 --> 01:05:18,284
and he found himself thinking

988
01:05:18,286 --> 01:05:20,486
about what the young girl
had said.

989
01:05:20,488 --> 01:05:22,488
It was hard to imagine.

990
01:05:22,490 --> 01:05:24,556
Could it really be true?

991
01:05:24,558 --> 01:05:26,558
But if they could all be happy,

992
01:05:26,560 --> 01:05:29,261
maybe he could be, too.

993
01:05:54,521 --> 01:05:56,022
What?

994
01:06:01,127 --> 01:06:03,328
Her head felt unsteady,

995
01:06:03,330 --> 01:06:05,296
and her heart was just sick.

996
01:06:05,298 --> 01:06:08,266
- Oh, no.
- It must be a joke

997
01:06:08,268 --> 01:06:10,901
or a prank or a trick.

998
01:06:10,903 --> 01:06:13,604
Who would do such a thing?

999
01:06:13,606 --> 01:06:17,007
Who would stoop down this low?

1000
01:06:17,009 --> 01:06:19,943
And then one little girl
realized...

1001
01:06:19,945 --> 01:06:22,181
she might just know.

1002
01:06:24,083 --> 01:06:28,352
3,000 feet up,
up the side of Mount Crumpit,

1003
01:06:28,354 --> 01:06:33,156
the Grinch rode with his load
to the tip-top to dump it.

1004
01:06:33,158 --> 01:06:34,624
Keep going.

1005
01:06:34,626 --> 01:06:36,560
We're gonna make it.

1006
01:06:37,995 --> 01:06:40,262
Oh, dear.
Wha... What happened?

1007
01:06:40,264 --> 01:06:44,166
- Where's the decorations?
- All the presents. - Aw, man.

1008
01:06:44,168 --> 01:06:47,436
Mom... it's my fault.

1009
01:06:47,438 --> 01:06:49,538
What... What is?

1010
01:06:49,540 --> 01:06:51,107
All of this.

1011
01:06:51,109 --> 01:06:53,342
I-I trapped Santa last night,

1012
01:06:53,344 --> 01:06:57,380
'cause I wanted to ask him to
do something special for you.

1013
01:06:57,382 --> 01:06:59,715
But I think I made him mad,

1014
01:06:59,717 --> 01:07:03,085
and that's why he stole
everyone's Christmas.

1015
01:07:03,087 --> 01:07:05,086
No. No, no. No, honey,

1016
01:07:05,088 --> 01:07:06,655
this isn't your fault.

1017
01:07:06,657 --> 01:07:09,190
He didn't steal Christmas.

1018
01:07:09,192 --> 01:07:11,660
He just stole stuff.

1019
01:07:11,662 --> 01:07:14,162
Christmas is in here.

1020
01:07:14,164 --> 01:07:18,669
And besides, I already have the
greatest gift I could ever get.

1021
01:07:20,337 --> 01:07:22,205
You.

1022
01:07:30,647 --> 01:07:33,314
Just one more shove.

1023
01:07:33,316 --> 01:07:37,619
What's that? Do you hear it?

1024
01:07:46,028 --> 01:07:48,262
They're singing?

1025
01:07:51,300 --> 01:07:53,033
I don't understand, Max.

1026
01:07:57,373 --> 01:07:59,273
Don't they know what I've done?

1027
01:08:16,057 --> 01:08:18,391
As he watched the small girl,

1028
01:08:18,393 --> 01:08:20,660
he thought he might melt.

1029
01:08:20,662 --> 01:08:23,229
If he did what she did,

1030
01:08:23,231 --> 01:08:26,232
would he feel what she felt?

1031
01:08:41,315 --> 01:08:43,649
And the luscious sound swelled,

1032
01:08:43,651 --> 01:08:46,451
reaching up to the skies.

1033
01:08:46,453 --> 01:08:49,154
And the Grinch heard
with his heart,

1034
01:08:49,156 --> 01:08:51,590
and it tripled in size.

1035
01:09:04,671 --> 01:09:06,271
What? Oh, no.

1036
01:09:06,273 --> 01:09:07,506
Oh! Aah!

1037
01:09:07,508 --> 01:09:09,273
No, no, no, no!

1038
01:09:09,275 --> 01:09:10,307
Oh, no!

1039
01:09:10,309 --> 01:09:12,345
Aah...!

1040
01:09:21,521 --> 01:09:23,521
No, don't worry.
I got it.

1041
01:09:25,324 --> 01:09:26,357
Max, it's okay. I'm...

1042
01:09:26,359 --> 01:09:27,825
Aah!

1043
01:09:29,795 --> 01:09:30,861
Whoa, oh...

1044
01:09:30,863 --> 01:09:32,431
Oh, no, no, no, no.

1045
01:09:35,200 --> 01:09:36,802
Max...!

1046
01:09:38,169 --> 01:09:40,806
Oh!

1047
01:10:04,362 --> 01:10:06,498
Fred?

1048
01:10:10,267 --> 01:10:12,167
You...

1049
01:10:12,169 --> 01:10:14,837
you came back.

1050
01:10:17,441 --> 01:10:20,442
Max, the gifts.
We have to return them.

1051
01:10:20,444 --> 01:10:22,544
And having heard

1052
01:10:22,546 --> 01:10:26,181
the Whos' goodness,
having felt the Whos' song,

1053
01:10:26,183 --> 01:10:30,285
he tried to make right
what he had made wrong.

1054
01:11:00,617 --> 01:11:01,882
Uh...

1055
01:11:01,884 --> 01:11:04,919
hello, everybody.

1056
01:11:04,921 --> 01:11:07,357
Uh...

1057
01:11:11,894 --> 01:11:13,894
Uh...

1058
01:11:13,896 --> 01:11:15,930
it was me.

1059
01:11:15,932 --> 01:11:18,431
I stole your Christmas.

1060
01:11:20,402 --> 01:11:22,903
I stole it because...

1061
01:11:22,905 --> 01:11:25,772
because I thought
it would fix something

1062
01:11:25,774 --> 01:11:28,310
that happened a long time ago.

1063
01:11:29,745 --> 01:11:32,479
But it didn't.

1064
01:11:32,481 --> 01:11:35,280
And I'm sorry.

1065
01:11:39,788 --> 01:11:42,822
I'm so very sorry.

1066
01:11:42,824 --> 01:11:45,192
For everything.

1067
01:12:06,714 --> 01:12:09,748
Not now, Max.

1068
01:12:09,750 --> 01:12:12,385
I need to be alone.

1069
01:12:35,875 --> 01:12:38,810
I-I-I kind of thought
you might like it.

1070
01:12:38,812 --> 01:12:40,878
You don't like it?
Oh, I could take it back.

1071
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:42,914
It's not a big deal.
I just thought maybe you...

1072
01:12:44,951 --> 01:12:46,951
Oh. Hey.

1073
01:12:46,953 --> 01:12:50,723
Merry Christmas
to you, too, Max.

1074
01:12:52,357 --> 01:12:54,524
Ha!

1075
01:12:57,696 --> 01:12:59,763
Uh, that's gonna get old.

1076
01:12:59,765 --> 01:13:02,401
What was that?

1077
01:13:06,605 --> 01:13:07,940
Huh?

1078
01:13:09,742 --> 01:13:11,975
Uh... hello.

1079
01:13:11,977 --> 01:13:13,509
Hi.

1080
01:13:13,511 --> 01:13:15,411
Remember me?

1081
01:13:15,413 --> 01:13:16,813
Yes. Yes, I do.

1082
01:13:16,815 --> 01:13:18,481
I remember you.

1083
01:13:18,483 --> 01:13:20,382
My name is Cindy-Lou.

1084
01:13:20,384 --> 01:13:21,918
Cindy-Lou Who.

1085
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:24,386
It's nice to meet you,
Cindy-Lou.

1086
01:13:24,388 --> 01:13:26,622
Uh, oh, m-my name is Grinch.

1087
01:13:26,624 --> 01:13:29,825
And, uh, th-this is Max.

1088
01:13:29,827 --> 01:13:33,763
Whoa! Nice to meet you, Max.

1089
01:13:33,765 --> 01:13:37,533
I just came to invite you to
our house for Christmas dinner.

1090
01:13:37,535 --> 01:13:39,400
What? Me?

1091
01:13:39,402 --> 01:13:42,337
But I took your gifts.

1092
01:13:42,339 --> 01:13:44,672
- Yeah, I know.
- And your trees.

1093
01:13:44,674 --> 01:13:45,908
Yup.

1094
01:13:45,910 --> 01:13:48,409
I stole your whole Christmas.

1095
01:13:48,411 --> 01:13:49,945
I know you did.

1096
01:13:49,947 --> 01:13:52,514
But we're inviting you anyway.

1097
01:13:52,516 --> 01:13:54,516
But why?

1098
01:13:54,518 --> 01:13:57,854
Because... you've been alone
long enough.

1099
01:13:59,689 --> 01:14:01,389
Dinner's at 6:00.

1100
01:14:01,391 --> 01:14:03,057
Don't be late.

1101
01:14:03,059 --> 01:14:06,427
And make sure you bring
your sweet doggy, too.

1102
01:14:25,414 --> 01:14:27,414
Right. Okay.

1103
01:14:27,416 --> 01:14:28,751
Hmm.

1104
01:14:29,952 --> 01:14:32,653
Hmm.

1105
01:14:32,655 --> 01:14:35,556
Um, this is a bad idea.
I-I-I can't...

1106
01:14:35,558 --> 01:14:37,791
I can't do this,
I can't do this.

1107
01:14:37,793 --> 01:14:40,426
They're all gonna hate me.

1108
01:14:41,964 --> 01:14:44,397
All right.

1109
01:14:44,399 --> 01:14:45,631
Mm!

1110
01:14:45,633 --> 01:14:47,500
I did it.

1111
01:14:48,603 --> 01:14:50,436
Oh! Mr. Grinch!

1112
01:14:50,438 --> 01:14:52,872
I'm so happy
you decided to come.

1113
01:14:52,874 --> 01:14:54,141
Welcome.

1114
01:14:54,143 --> 01:14:56,676
Th-Thank you for inviting me.

1115
01:14:56,678 --> 01:14:59,011
Uh, I-I wore a tie.

1116
01:14:59,013 --> 01:15:02,882
And it's a very nice tie.
Cindy-Lou! Look who came!

1117
01:15:02,884 --> 01:15:05,117
Mr. Grinch! You're here!

1118
01:15:05,119 --> 01:15:06,752
Hello.

1119
01:15:06,754 --> 01:15:08,788
Come on in.
I'll show you around.

1120
01:15:08,790 --> 01:15:11,691
Oh. Okay.

1121
01:15:14,461 --> 01:15:16,062
Hello, Mr. Grinch.

1122
01:15:16,064 --> 01:15:17,864
Merry Christmas.

1123
01:15:17,866 --> 01:15:19,731
Merry Christmas to you, too.

1124
01:15:19,733 --> 01:15:21,167
Aunt Ida,

1125
01:15:21,169 --> 01:15:23,869
I'd like you to meet
my friend, the Grinch.

1126
01:15:23,871 --> 01:15:26,205
Oh, it's nice to meet you,
Mr. Grinch.

1127
01:15:26,207 --> 01:15:28,207
Thank you.
It's nice to be here.

1128
01:15:31,111 --> 01:15:32,978
Oh, here,
let me take that for you.

1129
01:15:32,980 --> 01:15:34,779
Oh. Thank you.

1130
01:15:34,781 --> 01:15:36,815
Cindy-Lou, could you make a
little room for this, please...

1131
01:15:36,817 --> 01:15:38,583
No, don't worry.
I-I've got it.

1132
01:15:38,585 --> 01:15:40,952
Huh. Isn't that thoughtful?

1133
01:15:45,959 --> 01:15:48,525
- Well, is that grouchy, grumpy...
- Huh?

1134
01:15:48,527 --> 01:15:51,662
- ...Grinchy I see standing over there? Ha-ha!
- Bricklebaum.

1135
01:15:51,664 --> 01:15:53,464
- Good to see you.
- Come on, Grinchy,

1136
01:15:53,466 --> 01:15:54,999
- give me a hug!
- Oh!

1137
01:15:55,001 --> 01:15:57,034
It don't count if you
don't hug back, buddy.

1138
01:15:59,872 --> 01:16:02,740
Okay, come take your seats,
everyone. Dinner's ready.

1139
01:16:02,742 --> 01:16:04,675
Come on.
You're sitting next to me.

1140
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:09,949
Here you go.

1141
01:16:12,985 --> 01:16:15,551
Oh. Oh.

1142
01:16:21,093 --> 01:16:23,826
This is
my first Christmas dinner.

1143
01:16:23,828 --> 01:16:26,097
- What happens?
- You'll see.

1144
01:16:28,667 --> 01:16:31,167
Would you... do the honors,
Mr. Grinch?

1145
01:16:31,169 --> 01:16:33,538
Oh. Uh, okay.

1146
01:16:35,874 --> 01:16:38,675
Do you mind
if I say something first?

1147
01:16:38,677 --> 01:16:40,575
Not at all.

1148
01:16:40,577 --> 01:16:42,544
Um, well, everybody,

1149
01:16:42,546 --> 01:16:45,114
I-I just want to say...

1150
01:16:45,116 --> 01:16:47,984
I've spent my entire life

1151
01:16:47,986 --> 01:16:51,488
hating Christmas
and everything about it.

1152
01:16:53,023 --> 01:16:57,260
But now I see that it
wasn't Christmas I hated.

1153
01:16:57,262 --> 01:17:00,464
It was being alone.

1154
01:17:05,169 --> 01:17:07,736
But I'm not alone anymore.

1155
01:17:07,738 --> 01:17:11,141
And I have all of you
to thank for it.

1156
01:17:12,176 --> 01:17:14,608
But especially...

1157
01:17:14,610 --> 01:17:17,245
this little girl right here.

1158
01:17:17,247 --> 01:17:20,815
Ma'am, your daughter's kindness

1159
01:17:20,817 --> 01:17:22,984
changed my life.

1160
01:17:22,986 --> 01:17:24,952
That's my girl.

1161
01:17:24,954 --> 01:17:26,153
Oh...

1162
01:17:26,155 --> 01:17:27,922
that was beautiful.

1163
01:17:27,924 --> 01:17:29,892
That's my best friend.

1164
01:17:30,960 --> 01:17:33,162
Merry Christmas, Mr. Grinch.

1165
01:17:34,197 --> 01:17:36,564
Merry Christmas, Cindy-Lou.

1166
01:17:36,566 --> 01:17:39,166
And the Grinch raised his glass

1167
01:17:39,168 --> 01:17:41,668
and led the Whos in a toast.

1168
01:17:41,670 --> 01:17:43,804
To kindness and love,

1169
01:17:43,806 --> 01:17:46,207
the things we need most.
