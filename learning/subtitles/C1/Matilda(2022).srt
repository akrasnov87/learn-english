00:37:13,458 --> 00:37:16,917
Y-- y-- yes, Miss Trunchbull?

693
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:23,292
What have I said about… pigtails?

694
00:37:23,875 --> 00:37:26,375
I hate pigtails.

695
00:37:26,458 --> 00:37:28,958
But my mummy likes them.
She says they make me look pretty.

696
00:37:29,042 --> 00:37:31,417
Well, your mother is a twit!

697
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:33,250
[sports announcer faintly over PA]
And here she goes!

698
00:37:33,333 --> 00:37:36,375
-Look at that spin!
-[Agatha grunting]

699
00:37:36,458 --> 00:37:37,958
[announcer] Oh, my word!

700
00:37:38,042 --> 00:37:39,292
[children gasping]

701
00:37:39,375 --> 00:37:41,708
[announcer] That's far! That's very…

702
00:37:43,042 --> 00:37:44,292
…and we're there!

703
00:37:44,875 --> 00:37:46,583
[Agatha] Yes! Still got it.

704
00:37:47,333 --> 00:37:50,583
Check and see if that child
is still alive, will you?

705
00:37:52,667 --> 00:37:54,333
[clears throat]

706
00:37:55,708 --> 00:37:57,500
And what is your name?

707
00:37:57,583 --> 00:37:58,417
Matilda.

708
00:37:59,208 --> 00:38:00,292
Matilda Wormwood.

709
00:38:00,375 --> 00:38:04,458
Oh! You're Wormwood, are you?

710
00:38:05,667 --> 00:38:08,583
I like troublemakers, Wormwood.

711
00:38:09,458 --> 00:38:11,542
They make such a lovely sound…

712
00:38:12,125 --> 00:38:14,375
when they snap.

713
00:38:15,083 --> 00:38:16,500
[boy] She's alive!

714
00:38:17,125 --> 00:38:19,250
-[boy 2] Hip, hip!
-[children] Hooray!

715
00:38:19,333 --> 00:38:21,333
-Hip, hip!
-Hooray!

716
00:38:21,417 --> 00:38:23,792
-Hip, hip!
-Hooray!

717
00:38:23,875 --> 00:38:25,625
[all cheering]

718
00:38:26,875 --> 00:38:29,958
[Agatha over PA] Remember, Wormwood,
you can never win.

719
00:38:30,042 --> 00:38:34,375
I promise you that.
And a promise is a promise is a promise.

720
00:38:37,292 --> 00:38:39,833
[Matilda] And so the great day arrived.

721
00:38:39,917 --> 00:38:43,375
The Burning Woman Hurling Through the Air

722
00:38:43,458 --> 00:38:45,875
With Dynamite in Her Hair

723
00:38:45,958 --> 00:38:49,250
Over Sharks and Spiky Objects

724
00:38:49,333 --> 00:38:51,958
Caught by the Man Locked in the Cage.

725
00:38:53,333 --> 00:38:57,708
It was like the entire world
had gathered to see the acrobat

726
00:38:57,792 --> 00:39:02,667
and the escapologist's incredible
death-defying feat.

727
00:39:03,542 --> 00:39:05,667
[plane flying overhead]

728
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:08,333
[crowd murmuring, chattering indistinctly]

729
00:39:14,042 --> 00:39:15,042
[laughing]

730
00:39:15,125 --> 00:39:17,917
[band playing upbeat music]

731
00:39:31,667 --> 00:39:33,250
[women laughing]

732
00:39:36,333 --> 00:39:38,625
Everything was arranged by…

733
00:39:39,708 --> 00:39:42,167
the acrobat's evil stepsister.

734
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:46,333
A frightening woman who used to be
an Olympic class hammer thrower.

735
00:39:46,917 --> 00:39:50,125
People whispered that in her dark
and brooding heart,

736
00:39:50,208 --> 00:39:53,833
she resented her stepsister's
success and love.

737
00:39:55,250 --> 00:39:56,625
[cymbal crashes]

738
00:39:56,708 --> 00:39:58,042
Suddenly…

739
00:39:58,958 --> 00:40:00,833
out came the escapologist,

740
00:40:00,917 --> 00:40:03,208
but there was no sign of the acrobat,

741
00:40:03,292 --> 00:40:06,917
and no glimpse at all
of the shiny white scarf she always wore.

742
00:40:08,208 --> 00:40:10,125
Ladies and gentlemen,

743
00:40:10,708 --> 00:40:12,500
boys and girls,

744
00:40:12,583 --> 00:40:16,167
The Burning Woman Hurling Through the Air

745
00:40:16,250 --> 00:40:18,875
With Dynamite in Her Hair

746
00:40:18,958 --> 00:40:21,292
Over Sharks and Spiky Objects

747
00:40:21,375 --> 00:40:23,625
Caught by the Man Locked in the Cage

748
00:40:23,708 --> 00:40:26,750
has been canceled!

749
00:40:26,833 --> 00:40:28,958
[all groaning]

750
00:40:29,750 --> 00:40:33,083
Canceled because my wife is…

751
00:40:33,833 --> 00:40:34,958
pregnant!

752
00:40:35,542 --> 00:40:37,542
-[all gasping]
-Oh, Matilda.

753
00:40:39,167 --> 00:40:42,292
[Matilda] Absolute… silence.

754
00:40:44,583 --> 00:40:47,250
You could have heard a fly burp.

755
00:40:49,833 --> 00:40:51,708
-Then suddenly, the audience…
-[child] Hip, hip!

756
00:40:51,792 --> 00:40:55,042
…jumped to its feet
and roared in appreciation!

757
00:40:55,125 --> 00:40:57,792
[band playing fanfare]

758
00:40:59,375 --> 00:41:00,500
[yapping]

759
00:41:00,583 --> 00:41:03,125
-The great feat was instantly forgotten.
-[laughing]

760
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,500
And the applause went on for over an hour!

761
00:41:09,917 --> 00:41:12,625
Oh, Matilda, that's wonderful!

762
00:41:12,708 --> 00:41:14,833
I love stories that end happily.

763
00:41:15,917 --> 00:41:20,708
Forgotten by everyone
except the acrobat's evil stepsister.

764
00:41:22,083 --> 00:41:26,500
When all had quietened down
she produced a contract!

765
00:41:26,583 --> 00:41:28,375
-[Mrs. Phelps] A contract?
-[feedback squealing]

766
00:41:28,458 --> 00:41:31,583
[over PA] A contract you have signed
to perform this feat.

767
00:41:31,667 --> 00:41:34,583
-And perform this feat, you shall!
-No.

768
00:41:34,667 --> 00:41:37,792
[Matilda and Agatha]
I've paid for the posters, publicity,

769
00:41:37,875 --> 00:41:40,292
the catering, the toilet facilities.

770
00:41:40,375 --> 00:41:42,292
If I give the crowd their money back,

771
00:41:42,375 --> 00:41:43,875
where is my profit?

772
00:41:44,458 --> 00:41:47,333
A contract is a contract is a contract.

773
00:41:47,417 --> 00:41:49,000
My hands are tied.

774
00:41:49,083 --> 00:41:52,292
The Burning Woman Hurling Through the Air

775
00:41:52,375 --> 00:41:54,250
With Dynamite in Her Hair

776
00:41:54,333 --> 00:41:57,000
Over Sharks and Spiky Objects

777
00:41:57,083 --> 00:42:00,292
Caught by The Man Locked in a Cage
will be performed,

778
00:42:00,375 --> 00:42:03,000
and it will be performed this day!

779
00:42:03,083 --> 00:42:05,667
Or off to prison you both shall go!

780
00:42:10,042 --> 00:42:11,958
What… what happened next?

781
00:42:13,667 --> 00:42:14,833
I dunno.

782
00:42:14,917 --> 00:42:16,875
What? How can you not know?

783
00:42:17,583 --> 00:42:20,667
It just comes to me in… fizzes.

784
00:42:20,750 --> 00:42:23,917
Well, could you fizz up
a little bit more for me? Now.

785
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:26,250
I don't think it works like that.

786
00:42:26,833 --> 00:42:28,000
Of course it doesn't.

787
00:42:28,625 --> 00:42:32,250
-Where is this coming from, Matilda?
-What do you mean?

788
00:42:32,333 --> 00:42:33,958
I mean, it's incredible.

789
00:42:34,042 --> 00:42:37,000
But it's taking rather a dark turn.

790
00:42:37,083 --> 00:42:38,750
Maybe I shouldn't tell you any more.

791
00:42:38,833 --> 00:42:41,292
No, no, no. No.

792
00:42:41,375 --> 00:42:43,417
We must find out how it ends.

793
00:42:44,458 --> 00:42:46,667
All I'm saying is,
is everything all right?

794
00:42:46,750 --> 00:42:47,667
You could tell me.

795
00:42:47,750 --> 00:42:51,208
I'd better go, Mrs. Phelps, Mum's waiting.

796
00:42:51,292 --> 00:42:53,833
She gets so upset when she's away from me.

797
00:42:53,917 --> 00:42:57,375
She says every minute
is like an eternity so…

798
00:42:58,167 --> 00:43:00,667
Is she coming here? Can I meet her?

799
00:43:00,750 --> 00:43:02,208
Bye, Mrs. Phelps!

800
00:43:02,292 --> 00:43:04,583
Matilda, tomorrow I'm at the windmill.

801
00:43:04,667 --> 00:43:06,417
Okay, I'll find you.

802
00:43:08,292 --> 00:43:10,833
[the Wormwoods arguing faintly]

803
00:43:12,625 --> 00:43:14,042
I've got it.

804
00:43:14,125 --> 00:43:16,125
-Harry! Let me have it!
-[clattering]

805
00:43:16,208 --> 00:43:18,000
-[Harry grunting loudly]
-[Mrs. Wormwood yells]

806
00:43:18,083 --> 00:43:19,417
Hang on then.

807
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:22,292
[both straining]

808
00:43:22,375 --> 00:43:24,458
-[Harry] You're hurting me!
-Yeah. Hold on, hold on.

809
00:43:28,417 --> 00:43:30,250
Let me pull, Harry.

810
00:43:30,333 --> 00:43:31,333
Pull then!

811
00:43:35,042 --> 00:43:37,333
[children chattering]

812
00:44:01,625 --> 00:44:02,458
Matilda.

813
00:44:05,958 --> 00:44:08,333
I believe your mind is extraordinary.

814
00:44:08,875 --> 00:44:11,500
So I'm taking things into my own hands.

815
00:44:12,625 --> 00:44:13,917
Starting tomorrow,

816
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:16,500
I'm going to bring in a selection
of very clever books.

817
00:44:16,583 --> 00:44:19,083
You can sit and read them
while I teach the others,

818
00:44:19,167 --> 00:44:21,958
and if you have any questions, well…

819
00:44:22,042 --> 00:44:23,750
I shall do my best to answer them.

820
00:44:25,042 --> 00:44:26,250
How does that sound?

821
00:44:29,583 --> 00:44:32,292
[gasps, chuckles]

822
00:44:33,542 --> 00:44:34,708
Matilda…

823
00:44:36,167 --> 00:44:37,792
That is the biggest hug in the world.

824
00:44:39,125 --> 00:44:41,333
You're going to hug all the air out of me.

825
00:44:43,792 --> 00:44:45,833
[Agatha, over PA]
What a touching little scene.

826
00:44:50,167 --> 00:44:51,042
Move!

827
00:44:51,750 --> 00:44:56,833
I believe I said this maggot
was to receive no special treatment.

828
00:44:56,917 --> 00:45:00,167
In fact, I seem to recall informing you

829
00:45:00,250 --> 00:45:05,917
that this particular snot-ball
was evil incarnate, did I not?

830
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,625
No, Miss Trunchbull, Matilda is not--

831
00:45:07,708 --> 00:45:09,417
Did you just say "no," Jenny?

832
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:11,833
To me?

833
00:45:14,792 --> 00:45:18,167
Matilda Wormwood is a criminal.

834
00:45:19,875 --> 00:45:21,042
[over PA] This morning,

835
00:45:21,125 --> 00:45:25,417
a piece of my private
chocolate cake was stolen.

836
00:45:27,667 --> 00:45:31,292
It is my contention that you performed
this vileness, Wormwood, you.

837
00:45:31,375 --> 00:45:33,917
You have two choices,
admit your guilt and be punished,

838
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,625
or call me a liar… and be punished.

839
00:45:39,917 --> 00:45:41,667
Think very carefully

840
00:45:41,750 --> 00:45:45,083
about what comes out
of your mouth, Wormwood.

841
00:45:45,667 --> 00:45:47,458
I did not stea--

842
00:45:47,542 --> 00:45:50,792
[loud, prolonged belch]

843
00:45:56,333 --> 00:45:57,917
[gasps]

844
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,542
[gasping]

845
00:46:21,875 --> 00:46:23,250
Chocolate.

846
00:46:23,958 --> 00:46:26,292
Bruce Bogtrotter.

847
00:46:28,458 --> 00:46:30,625
[timidly] Yes, Miss Trunchbull?

848
00:46:32,083 --> 00:46:34,417
Thank you, Maurice, that will be all.

849
00:46:35,792 --> 00:46:37,625
[grunting]

850
00:46:37,708 --> 00:46:41,958
Staff dismissed. Come on.
Everybody out. Everybody out, come on.

851
00:46:42,042 --> 00:46:42,958
[Agatha] Move!

852
00:46:55,125 --> 00:46:56,750
You liked my cake…

853
00:46:57,708 --> 00:46:58,833
didn't you, Bruce?

854
00:46:58,917 --> 00:47:02,000
Yes, Miss Trunchbull,
it was very delicious.

855
00:47:02,083 --> 00:47:03,542
So chocolatey.

856
00:47:04,125 --> 00:47:06,000
And I'm really very sorry, I--

857
00:47:06,083 --> 00:47:06,917
No, no…

858
00:47:07,792 --> 00:47:11,042
Just so long as you enjoyed the cake.
That's the main thing.

859
00:47:12,333 --> 00:47:13,167
Is it?

860
00:47:14,708 --> 00:47:16,250
[singsong] Oh, Cook.

861
00:47:34,333 --> 00:47:35,542
[cook coughs]

862
00:47:38,292 --> 00:47:39,125
Be still!

863
00:47:42,208 --> 00:47:44,500
What's the matter, Bogtrotter?
Lost your appetite?

864
00:47:45,042 --> 00:47:48,750
Don't worry… all you have to do
is eat every last crumb.

865
00:47:50,167 --> 00:47:54,125
And if you perform this incredible feat,
I promise you,

866
00:47:54,208 --> 00:47:56,042
all will be forgiven.

867
00:47:56,125 --> 00:47:58,042
[hesitating] Every crumb?

868
00:47:59,167 --> 00:48:01,333
-But I'm full.

as he struggled in his chains,

1038
00:58:34,542 --> 00:58:37,458
knowing that the tiniest, weeniest mistake

1039
00:58:37,542 --> 00:58:40,417
would mean that he'd lose her
and their child forever.

1040
00:58:41,042 --> 00:58:43,125
Seven seconds, and suddenly…

1041
00:58:43,208 --> 00:58:45,458
-[yells loudly]
-[Matilda] She let go!

1042
00:58:49,250 --> 00:58:52,292
The escapologist reached out
with one huge, massive arm

1043
00:58:52,375 --> 00:58:53,625
to catch his wife and the child.

1044
00:58:53,708 --> 00:58:55,417
-[acrobat gasps]
-[grunts]

1045
00:58:55,500 --> 00:58:57,333
-[Matilda] Eight seconds!
-No, I can't look.

1046
00:58:57,417 --> 00:59:00,542
Nine seconds! Ten seconds! And…

1047
00:59:01,208 --> 00:59:04,583
And… And… Eleven seconds!

1048
00:59:04,667 --> 00:59:09,333
He grabbed the dynamite
and flung it far, far away!

1049
00:59:09,417 --> 00:59:13,333
Hurray! So this story does
have a happy ending after all.

1050
00:59:14,167 --> 00:59:15,000
No.

1051
00:59:16,667 --> 00:59:17,583
No, it doesn't.

1052
00:59:18,833 --> 00:59:20,333
[crowd gasping]

1053

[acrobat exclaims]

1054
00:59:30,875 --> 00:59:34,042
No! Was she okay? Did she survive?

1055
00:59:34,625 --> 00:59:37,292
She broke every bone in her body.

1056
00:59:37,958 --> 00:59:40,167
Except the ones at the ends
of her little fingers.

1057
00:59:41,125 --> 00:59:44,042
She did manage to live long enough
to have their child.

1058
00:59:44,125 --> 00:59:46,542
[baby fussing]

1059
00:59:47,958 --> 00:59:49,625
But the effort was too great.

1060
00:59:51,208 --> 00:59:52,833
Love our girl.

1061
00:59:54,500 --> 00:59:58,042
Love our daughter with all your heart.

1062
00:59:59,667 --> 01:00:02,458
She is all we ever wanted.

1063
01:00:09,250 --> 01:00:11,167
[crying softly]

1064
01:00:12,708 --> 01:00:13,875
And then she died.

1065
01:00:16,708 --> 01:00:17,750
And then…

1066
01:00:18,750 --> 01:00:20,125
things got worse.

1067
01:00:20,208 --> 01:00:21,750
What? Worse?

1068
01:00:21,833 --> 01:00:23,417
I'm afraid they did.

1069
01:00:23,500 --> 01:00:25,875
Because the escapologist was so kind

1070
01:00:25,958 --> 01:00:30,042
that he never for one second blamed
the evil stepsister for what happened.

1071
01:00:30,917 --> 01:00:35,708
In fact, he asked her to move in
and help look after his daughter.

1072
01:00:35,792 --> 01:00:38,167
[Mrs. Phelps] No, no,
don't ask her to move in.

1073
01:00:38,250 --> 01:00:40,500
She was nothing but cruel
to the little girl,

1074
01:00:40,583 --> 01:00:43,708
making her wash and clean
all day long. Shouting,

1075
01:00:43,792 --> 01:00:46,208
[Matilda and stepsister]
"Clean the floor and I'll be nice!"

1076
01:00:46,292 --> 01:00:49,458
When the little girl did clean it,
she was even crueler

1077
01:00:49,542 --> 01:00:52,417
because she was
a terrible, terrible cheat!

1078
01:00:52,500 --> 01:00:53,625
I hate cheats!

1079
01:00:53,708 --> 01:00:57,667
All in secret, so the escapologist
never suspected a thing.

1080
01:00:57,750 --> 01:01:00,750
And so the poor little girl grew up
with the meanest, cruelest,

1081
01:01:00,833 --> 01:01:03,875
horriblest aunt
you could possibly imagine!

1082
01:01:03,958 --> 01:01:06,042
Let's call the police! [panting]

1083
01:01:07,042 --> 01:01:08,208
Mrs. Phelps.

1084
01:01:09,125 --> 01:01:10,667
It's just a story.

1085
01:01:11,250 --> 01:01:12,125
What?

1086
01:01:14,333 --> 01:01:16,708
Oh. Yes, of course.

1087
01:01:17,375 --> 01:01:18,375
A story.

1088
01:01:19,167 --> 01:01:21,500
It's just, you make it so real.

1089
01:01:22,375 --> 01:01:24,083
[relieved laugh] Your mind, Matilda.

1090
01:01:24,583 --> 01:01:28,042
Your parents must think they've won
the lottery with a child like you.

1091
01:01:28,667 --> 01:01:30,708
Oh… they do.

1092
01:01:31,667 --> 01:01:33,250
They're always saying that.

1093
01:01:33,333 --> 01:01:35,833
In fact, they say,

1094
01:01:35,917 --> 01:01:39,500
"We're so proud of you, Matilda,
you're like winning the…"

1095
01:01:43,333 --> 01:01:45,750
Yeah. I'd better go.

1096

01:01:50,625 --> 01:01:53,833
It's just like winning the lottery!

Me?

1100
01:01:56,792 --> 01:01:59,250
You? No, you're like
eating someone else's bogeys.

1101
01:01:59,333 --> 01:02:01,583

1102

I'm a girl.

1103
01:02:02,792 --> 01:02:04,542
But how, Harry?

1104
01:02:04,625 --> 01:02:06,208
Remember that big, muscly idiot?

1105
01:02:06,292 --> 01:02:08,958
Turns out he had a whole lot
of muscly mates.

1106
01:02:09,042 --> 01:02:10,625
Bucketloads of cash.

1107
01:02:10,708 --> 01:02:13,042
Everyone wanting a luxury car.

1108
01:02:13,125 --> 01:02:17,292
All I had was a load of old bangers,
each with 100,000 miles on the clock.

1109
01:02:17,375 --> 01:02:20,375
So, I did what any decent
business leader would.

1110
01:02:20,458 --> 01:02:21,500
What?

1111
01:02:21,583 --> 01:02:22,875
I bought a drill.

1112
01:02:22,958 --> 01:02:26,875
Attached it to the speedometer
and whacked it in reverse.

1113
01:02:26,958 --> 01:02:29,417
I put back the mileage
on every one of those cars

1114
01:02:29,500 --> 01:02:33,083
and sold them to those big,
muscly idiots, resulting in…

1115
01:02:33,167 --> 01:02:34,875
Money!

1116
01:02:34,958 --> 01:02:36,083
But you cheated them!

1117
01:02:37,417 --> 01:02:38,333
Excuse me?

1118
01:02:38,417 --> 01:02:41,875
You cheated them.
What you did, it wasn't right.

1119
01:02:41,958 --> 01:02:43,417
You're just a cheat!

1120
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,375
Oh, the little pig!

1121
01:02:47,500 --> 01:02:50,875
It's the books, Harry.
It's the books and the stories.

1122
01:02:50,958 --> 01:02:52,250
Is it now?

1123
01:02:53,125 --> 01:02:53,958
Books, is it?

1124
01:02:56,750 --> 01:02:58,500
You know what I'm going to do tomorrow?

1125
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:00,583
I'm going to go down to that library,

1126
01:03:01,375 --> 01:03:05,750
I'm going to tell that old bag
to never let you in again.

1127
01:03:05,833 --> 01:03:07,125
What?

1128
01:03:07,208 --> 01:03:10,000
Always sticking your nose in
where it don't belong.

1129
01:03:10,750 --> 01:03:14,875

[gasping]

1131
01:03:22,958 --> 01:03:27,667
That night, the escapologist's daughter
cried herself to sleep.

1132
01:03:27,750 --> 01:03:31,458
She never said a word
about the evil step-aunt's bullying.

1133
01:03:31,542 --> 01:03:33,875
She didn't want to add
to her father's pain.

1134
01:03:34,583 --> 01:03:38,083
This only encouraged the woman
to greater cruelties,

1135
01:03:38,167 --> 01:03:41,500
until one day she exploded.

1136
01:03:42,250 --> 01:03:45,042
[Agatha and Matilda] Sticking your
nose in where it doesn't belong!

1137

You nasty little creep!

1138
01:03:47,542 --> 01:03:50,667
And she threw her…
threw her into a dank,

1139
01:03:50,750 --> 01:03:54,292
dark, dusty cellar,
locked the door and went out.

[car approaching]

1141
01:03:57,417 --> 01:04:01,083
But that night, the escapologist
happened to come home early.

1142
01:04:02,667 --> 01:04:05,542
And when he heard the sound
of his daughter's tears,

1143
01:04:05,625 --> 01:04:08,000
-he smashed the door open.

with that incredible mind of yours.

You mean, there's no room in my head

But I'm poorer even than most.

1430
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:38,583
You see, my father died when I was young.

1431
01:22:38,667 --> 01:22:42,042
Magnus was his name. He was so kind.

1432
01:22:42,750 --> 01:22:46,125
[sighing] But… when he was gone,

1433
01:22:46,208 --> 01:22:48,708
my aunt became my legal guardian.

1434
01:22:49,375 --> 01:22:54,208
And she was cruel and mean
like you cannot even imagine.

1435
01:22:54,792 --> 01:22:58,375
Then when I became a teacher,
she presented me with a bill.

1436
01:22:59,167 --> 01:23:00,542
She'd written everything down.

1437
01:23:00,625 --> 01:23:04,958
Every teabag, every gas bill,
every tin of beans.

1438
01:23:05,042 --> 01:23:08,750
She made me sign a contract
to pay her back every single penny.

1439
01:23:09,250 --> 01:23:10,083
Really?

1440
01:23:10,167 --> 01:23:13,917
She even produced a document that said
that my father gave her his house.

1441
01:23:14,875 --> 01:23:17,750
But did he really do that, Magnus,

1442
01:23:17,833 --> 01:23:19,875
did he just give her his house?

1443
01:23:20,917 --> 01:23:25,000
Well, I've always felt it was…
suspicious.

1444
01:23:25,583 --> 01:23:28,917
You see, she said his death
was an accident, but…

1445
01:23:30,583 --> 01:23:32,125
You think she did him in!

1446

Well, I cannot say for sure.

1447

bullied by that woman made me, well…

01:32:40,458 --> 01:32:41,500
Children…

1545
01:32:43,125 --> 01:32:46,917
How can I be your headmistress

1546
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:52,250
if I cannot chill you to the bone?

1547
01:32:52,917 --> 01:32:53,750
Mm?

1548
01:32:54,458 --> 01:32:57,958
If the small ones don't pee just a little

1549
01:32:58,042 --> 01:33:00,167
when I walk into the room,
well then I'm…

1550
01:33:01,042 --> 01:33:05,833
failing as an educator.

1551
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:09,875
So…

1552
01:33:11,250 --> 01:33:13,792
Today we are going
to have a spelling test.

1553
01:33:15,458 --> 01:33:21,875
And any child who gets one
single answer wrong…

1554
01:33:23,083 --> 01:33:26,542
goes to Chokey.

1555
01:33:26,625 --> 01:33:28,083
You can't do that!

1556
01:33:29,292 --> 01:33:30,875
Oh, really? Why?

1557
01:33:30,958 --> 01:33:33,167
Because of yesterday's little…

1558
01:33:33,250 --> 01:33:34,958
[mimics explosion]

1559
01:33:35,042 --> 01:33:37,000
…incident, you mean?

1560
01:33:37,750 --> 01:33:40,208
Well, here's a surprise Chokey.

1561
01:33:42,750 --> 01:33:44,458
[gasping]

1562
01:33:45,000 --> 01:33:46,208
-You!
-[gasps]

1563
01:33:47,375 --> 01:33:49,042
Spell, oh, let me see…

1564
01:33:49,625 --> 01:33:50,625
"newt."

1565
01:33:50,708 --> 01:33:55,000
N-E-W-T. Newt.

1566
01:33:56,667 --> 01:33:57,500
What?

1567
01:33:58,375 --> 01:33:59,375
How do you know that?

1568
01:33:59,458 --> 01:34:02,458
Miss Honey taught us.
She's very good at teaching.

1569
01:34:03,917 --> 01:34:05,167
Nonsense!

1570
01:34:05,250 --> 01:34:08,958
Miss Honey's far too soft and peachy

1571
01:34:09,042 --> 01:34:10,792
to be good at anything!

1572
01:34:10,875 --> 01:34:11,917
You!

1573
01:34:12,875 --> 01:34:16,833
Spell the one thing you all are.

1574
01:34:16,917 --> 01:34:19,875
Spell "revolting."

1575
01:34:20,458 --> 01:34:24,333
Revolting. R-E-V-O-L-T…

1576
01:34:25,500 --> 01:34:27,083
I-N-G. Revolting.

1577
01:34:27,167 --> 01:34:29,083
You're cheating, pigtails!

1578
01:34:29,167 --> 01:34:32,375
Of course she's not cheating!
She's simply spelling the word.

1579
01:34:32,458 --> 01:34:34,750
I just taught them with kindness
and patience and respect.

1580
01:34:34,833 --> 01:34:37,417
How dare you bring
those words into my classroom!

1581
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:41,833
You. Snot-nose.

1582
01:34:42,542 --> 01:34:43,792
Stand and spell…

1583
01:34:45,417 --> 01:34:49,958
"amchellakamanialseptricolistimosis."

1584
01:34:50,042 --> 01:34:51,917
But that's not even a word.

1585
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:53,417
Spell it or go to Chokey.

1586
01:34:53,500 --> 01:34:55,458
And I should warn you,
it has silent letters.

1587

and every one of you has failed.
