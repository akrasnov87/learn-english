1
00:00:30,407 --> 00:00:33,368
Illumination!
Illumination!

2
00:01:26,713 --> 00:01:28,340
<i>I've lived in this city
all my life.</i>

3
00:01:29,007 --> 00:01:30,175
<i>I'm Max.</i>

4
00:01:30,342 --> 00:01:32,886
<i>And I'm the luckiest dog
in New York</i>

5
00:01:33,053 --> 00:01:34,763
<i>because of her.</i>

6
00:01:34,846 --> 00:01:36,265
<i>That's Katie.</i>

7
00:01:36,431 --> 00:01:37,432
<i>Katie and I...</i>

8
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:39,268
<i>Well, we have
the perfect relationship.</i>

9
00:01:40,269 --> 00:01:41,603
<i>We met a few years ago.</i>

10
00:01:42,771 --> 00:01:43,939
<i>And, boy, let me tell ya,</i>

11
00:01:44,022 --> 00:01:46,441
<i>we got along right away.</i>

12
00:01:46,566 --> 00:01:47,835
<i>It was one of those
relationships</i>

13
00:01:47,859 --> 00:01:49,736
<i>where you just know.</i>

14
00:01:51,697 --> 00:01:52,781
<i>And get this!</i>

15
00:01:52,948 --> 00:01:55,951
<i>She was looking
for a roommate.
And so was I!</i>

16
00:01:56,118 --> 00:01:59,079
<i>So I just moved
in that same day.</i>

17
00:01:59,246 --> 00:02:00,872
<i>It was perfect.</i>

18
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:03,458
We've been together
ever since.

19
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:07,713
<i>Katie would do
anything for me.</i>

20
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:09,756
<i>And I'm her loyal protector.</i>

21
00:02:15,679 --> 00:02:16,680
<i>Our love is...</i>

22
00:02:17,222 --> 00:02:18,932
<i>How do I put this?</i>

23
00:02:19,099 --> 00:02:20,851
<i>Our love is
stronger than words.</i>

24
00:02:21,935 --> 00:02:23,729
<i>Or shoes.</i>

25
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:26,106
<i>It's me and Katie.</i>

26
00:02:27,399 --> 00:02:28,775
<i>Katie and me.</i>

27
00:02:31,903 --> 00:02:33,572
<i>Us against the world.</i>

28
00:02:39,953 --> 00:02:42,914
<i>I wouldn't go so far as
to call us soul mates,</i>

29
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,459
<i>even though any sane person
who saw us would.</i>

30
00:03:02,476 --> 00:03:04,770
<i>There's just one
little problem.</i>

31
00:03:04,895 --> 00:03:07,105
<i>Pretty much every day...</i>

32
00:03:07,272 --> 00:03:08,273
Come on, Max.

33
00:03:08,398 --> 00:03:09,441
<i>...she leaves.</i>

34
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:11,818
I'll see you tonight.

35
00:03:11,985 --> 00:03:14,821
<i>Sometimes I try stuff
to get her to stay.</i>

36
00:03:14,946 --> 00:03:16,281
Okay.

37
00:03:16,448 --> 00:03:17,616
Sit.

38
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:19,826
Spin.

39
00:03:20,786 --> 00:03:21,828
Speak.

40
00:03:22,621 --> 00:03:24,873
Okay.
That's a good boy.

41
00:03:24,998 --> 00:03:26,666
<i>But it never works.</i>

42
00:03:27,918 --> 00:03:29,378
<i>Where is she going?</i>

43
00:03:31,338 --> 00:03:33,799
<i>What could she
possibly be doing?</i>

44
00:03:35,842 --> 00:03:38,845
Oh, I miss her so much.

45
00:03:40,806 --> 00:03:42,349
Oh my!
She's back!

46
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:44,518
Forgot my phone.

47
00:03:44,643 --> 00:03:46,812
What took so long?
Why did you...

48
00:03:46,978 --> 00:03:49,147
Oh, come on!

49
00:03:49,773 --> 00:03:50,774
Oh!

50
00:03:50,982 --> 00:03:53,568
I miss her so much.

51
00:03:53,693 --> 00:03:56,196
Bye, Gidget.
Be a good doggy.

52
00:04:03,662 --> 00:04:04,871
Hey, Max.

53
00:04:05,038 --> 00:04:06,081
Hey, Gidget.

54
00:04:06,206 --> 00:04:07,624
Any plans today?

55
00:04:07,749 --> 00:04:08,750
Uh, yes.

56
00:04:08,834 --> 00:04:10,877
Big, big stuff today,
Gidget. I got big plans.

57
00:04:10,961 --> 00:04:14,005
I'm gonna sit here,
and I'm gonna wait
for Katie to come back.

58
00:04:14,172 --> 00:04:15,507
Oh, that sounds
exciting.

59
00:04:15,632 --> 00:04:17,259
Well, I won't interrupt.

60
00:04:17,384 --> 00:04:20,178
I've got a very
busy day, too.

61
00:04:24,224 --> 00:04:27,436
Here you go.
See you later, Chloe.

62
00:04:34,401 --> 00:04:36,027
 Bye, Peppy.

63
00:04:45,745 --> 00:04:46,997
So long, Mel.

64
00:04:50,917 --> 00:04:52,878
Bye, Sweetpea.

65
00:04:53,044 --> 00:04:55,130
See you, Gino.

66
00:04:55,255 --> 00:04:56,715
Bye,
Mr. Wiggles.
So long, pal.

67
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:57,841
I'll miss you, Shelly!

68
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:59,342
Later, Runty.

69
00:04:59,468 --> 00:05:00,469
Bye, everyone.

70
00:05:00,594 --> 00:05:01,803
Bye.

71
00:05:43,178 --> 00:05:45,597
Mmm.

72
00:06:56,835 --> 00:06:58,837
You be a good boy,
Leonard.

73
00:07:11,349 --> 00:07:12,434
Hey, Max.

74
00:07:12,601 --> 00:07:15,812
Hey, Chloe, do you
ever wonder where
they go during the day?

75
00:07:15,937 --> 00:07:17,355
Do you know what?
I just...

76
00:07:17,522 --> 00:07:18,982
I don't really care.

77
00:07:19,149 --> 00:07:20,900
Maybe that's what
it's like for you,

78
00:07:21,026 --> 00:07:22,826
but Katie and I have
a different relationship.

79
00:07:22,944 --> 00:07:25,155
You're a cat.
So maybe that's why.

80
00:07:25,322 --> 00:07:27,682
Because nobody could
ever love a cat the way
they love a dog.

81
00:07:27,782 --> 00:07:29,784
I'm just saying.
Maybe that's why.

82
00:07:29,951 --> 00:07:32,120
Whatever you need
to tell yourself.

83
00:07:38,209 --> 00:07:39,544
Hey! Morning, Max!

84
00:07:39,628 --> 00:07:40,629
Hey, Guys.

85
00:07:41,212 --> 00:07:43,089
What's up, Sweetpea?

86
00:07:43,715 --> 00:07:45,800
Hey, Mel,
where you been, man?

87
00:07:45,967 --> 00:07:47,218
Oh! Get this!

88
00:07:47,385 --> 00:07:50,347
Last Sunday, my owner
feeds me a small
white pill, right?

89
00:07:50,513 --> 00:07:52,182
I start to feel
a little groggy.

90
00:07:52,349 --> 00:07:55,060
The next thing I know,
I wake up, I'm in the sky!

91
00:07:55,185 --> 00:07:56,728
Wait a minute. The sky?

92
00:07:56,895 --> 00:07:59,397
Yeah. There are
suitcases everywhere.
I'm locked up in a crate.

93
00:07:59,564 --> 00:08:01,816
Come on.
There are suitcases
in the sky?

94
00:08:01,983 --> 00:08:04,319
So, I pass out
from fear, and
when I wake up

95
00:08:04,486 --> 00:08:06,321
I'm in Florida.

96
00:08:06,488 --> 00:08:07,697
Um. This
did not happen.

97
00:08:07,864 --> 00:08:09,908
I will never
eat a pill
like that again.

98
00:08:10,033 --> 00:08:11,576
Unless it's covered
in peanut butter.

99
00:08:11,743 --> 00:08:14,996
Because, I mean,
come on! Right?
It's peanut butter!

100
00:08:16,206 --> 00:08:17,207
Hey, guys.

101
00:08:17,374 --> 00:08:18,625
Oh, hey, Norman.

102
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:20,460
You still looking
for your apartment?

103
00:08:20,585 --> 00:08:22,837
Yeah. Going
on three weeks now.

104
00:08:23,004 --> 00:08:24,756
Is this the second
or the third floor?

105
00:08:24,881 --> 00:08:27,717
I don't know any
numbers, but, uh,
you don't live here.

106
00:08:27,842 --> 00:08:29,260
Ah! Pellets!

107
00:08:30,053 --> 00:08:31,262
Well, see you guys later.

108
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:34,015
You know what?
You can do it!

109
00:08:34,182 --> 00:08:35,684
He can't do it.

110
00:08:36,935 --> 00:08:38,561
Buddy!
There you are.

111
00:08:38,687 --> 00:08:39,729
Did you find it?

112
00:08:40,271 --> 00:08:42,399
You know I did.

113
00:08:45,276 --> 00:08:46,361
Ball!

114
00:08:46,444 --> 00:08:47,737
Ball, ball, ball!

115
00:08:48,321 --> 00:08:49,948
Katie's gonna
be so excited!

116
00:08:50,115 --> 00:08:51,908
This is exactly like
the one she lost!

117
00:08:52,075 --> 00:08:53,284
I mean,
look at it!

118
00:08:53,451 --> 00:08:55,412
It's round.
It fits in my mouth.

119
00:08:56,121 --> 00:08:57,414
Ball!

120
00:08:59,749 --> 00:09:00,750
Ooh!

121
00:09:07,716 --> 00:09:10,009
There is no other
ball in the city

122
00:09:10,093 --> 00:09:12,220
like this one ball,
guaranteed.
Whoa!

123
00:09:12,387 --> 00:09:13,930
This is the ball.

124
00:09:24,107 --> 00:09:25,817
Hey.
Katie!

125
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:27,736
I'm home, Max.

126
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:29,571
Hey, Maximilian.

127
00:09:29,696 --> 00:09:31,156
How was your day, buddy?

128
00:09:31,322 --> 00:09:32,949
That's a good boy.

129
00:09:33,116 --> 00:09:36,286
Oh, yes. I'm so psyched
to see you too, buddy.

130
00:09:36,453 --> 00:09:38,329
Okay, boy.
Calm down, it's okay.

131
00:09:38,496 --> 00:09:39,748
Let's all be calm.

132
00:09:39,914 --> 00:09:42,459
Now, I have
some big news.

133
00:09:42,584 --> 00:09:46,087
I know this'll take
some getting used to,

134
00:09:47,005 --> 00:09:49,382
but I think it's
gonna be a great thing
in the long...

135
00:09:49,466 --> 00:09:50,467
Oh!

136
00:09:51,009 --> 00:09:53,303
Max, this is Duke.

137
00:09:55,346 --> 00:09:57,307
He's going
to be your

138
00:09:57,474 --> 00:09:58,516
brother.

139
00:10:00,769 --> 00:10:02,520
No, Max.

140
00:10:02,687 --> 00:10:04,355
It's gonna be
all right, Duke.

141
00:10:04,522 --> 00:10:06,024
It's okay.

142
00:10:13,198 --> 00:10:16,159
Aww. See?
He likes you.

143
00:10:18,369 --> 00:10:19,829
Whoa!

144
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:21,873
Aww.

145
00:10:22,123 --> 00:10:24,876
Yeah, that's it, Duke.
Take a look around.

146
00:10:26,377 --> 00:10:29,464
I know, buddy.
This is a lot to take in.

147
00:10:29,964 --> 00:10:31,549
But he didn't
have a home.

148
00:10:31,716 --> 00:10:34,803
So you and I are gonna
have to take care
of him.

149
00:10:34,886 --> 00:10:36,054
Okay?

150
00:10:37,388 --> 00:10:38,932
Oh, my gosh!

151
00:10:39,057 --> 00:10:41,059
Duke found
our lost ball!

152
00:10:41,226 --> 00:10:43,520
What a great
team we're gonna be.

153
00:11:00,078 --> 00:11:01,704
Love you, Maxie.

154
00:11:03,873 --> 00:11:05,208
Love you, Duke.

155
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:13,550
Sleep tight, boys.

156
00:11:16,970 --> 00:11:17,971
Psst.

157
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:20,431
Psst.

158
00:11:21,766 --> 00:11:23,977
Hey. Little guy.

159
00:11:24,143 --> 00:11:26,729
This place
is so great!

160
00:11:26,855 --> 00:11:29,232
Uh-huh.
By the way...

161
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:31,317
That is one
gorgeous bed.

162
00:11:31,484 --> 00:11:33,069
Yeah, it's okay.

163
00:11:33,236 --> 00:11:34,320
Maybe we could share?

164
00:11:34,445 --> 00:11:37,824
You know, one night
you get the bed.
The next night, I do.

165
00:11:37,991 --> 00:11:39,117
That kind of thing.

166
00:11:39,284 --> 00:11:40,702
You know,
this bed is mine.

167
00:11:40,827 --> 00:11:42,620
You? You get
an old blanket.

168
00:11:42,787 --> 00:11:43,830
That suits you.

169
00:11:43,997 --> 00:11:47,667
You're an old-blanket
kind of a dog.
on, wow.

170
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:49,794
You are stubborn.

171
00:11:49,961 --> 00:11:52,547
Hey, I get it.
I'm stubborn, too.

172
00:11:52,672 --> 00:11:54,733
But we gotta
learn to get along.
Wait. What are you...

173
00:11:54,757 --> 00:11:56,801
I bet we can
both fit in this bed
if we really try.

174
00:11:56,968 --> 00:11:58,011
Let me scoot on
in there.

175
00:11:58,177 --> 00:11:59,637
No, wait.
Ah!

176
00:11:59,804 --> 00:12:02,307
Perfect. This is
comfy, right?

177
00:12:02,473 --> 00:12:04,142
No, it is not.

178
00:12:04,517 --> 00:12:06,436
I'm comfy.

179
00:12:08,771 --> 00:12:11,024
Duke is just
ruining our lives!

180
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:13,443
It's an emergency that
you get rid of this dog.

181
00:12:13,526 --> 00:12:14,527
He stole my...

182
00:12:17,614 --> 00:12:19,157
And he's scary,
and he's frightening,

183
00:12:19,324 --> 00:12:21,117
and he's the death
of all good things.

184
00:12:21,284 --> 00:12:23,369
Aww. You little
cutie pie.

185
00:12:23,494 --> 00:12:25,330
We'll play tomorrow,
buddy, okay?

186
00:12:25,496 --> 00:12:26,623
Okay, sleep well.

187
00:12:28,625 --> 00:12:30,585
Are you trying
to get rid of me?

188
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:32,670
Before I answer that...

189
00:12:32,837 --> 00:12:35,131
I'd like to know
how much you heard.

190
00:12:35,256 --> 00:12:37,133
So, that's how
it's gonna be, huh?

191
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:39,469
Oh, man, are you
making me angry!

192
00:12:39,636 --> 00:12:42,430
And when I get angry,
I do this.

193
00:12:44,307 --> 00:12:45,600
And I don't want to do that.

194
00:12:45,725 --> 00:12:47,310
I need this place.

195
00:12:47,477 --> 00:12:49,896
And if it's gonna
come down to you or me...

196
00:12:50,063 --> 00:12:51,856
It's gonna be me.

197
00:13:44,659 --> 00:13:45,827
Morning, Max!

198
00:13:45,994 --> 00:13:48,246
Max! Max! What
are you doing? Hi!

199
00:13:48,413 --> 00:13:50,665
It's me! Hi! Hi!

200
00:13:51,666 --> 00:13:52,709
Chloe!

201
00:13:52,834 --> 00:13:55,962
- Chloe, Chloe!
- I got a bad situation.

202
00:13:56,713 --> 00:13:58,965
Katie brought home
a new dog from the pound.

203
00:13:59,132 --> 00:14:01,801
She said he's my brother.
I don't want a brother.

204
00:14:01,968 --> 00:14:03,636
I don't even
have a bed now.

205
00:14:03,803 --> 00:14:05,805
I'm sleeping on the floor,
like a dog.

206
00:14:05,972 --> 00:14:07,765
Why would Katie
do this to me?

207
00:14:07,932 --> 00:14:10,101
Because she's
a dog person, Max.

208
00:14:10,226 --> 00:14:14,689
And dog people do weird,
inexplicable things.

209
00:14:14,856 --> 00:14:16,524
Like they get dogs
instead of cats.

210
00:14:16,649 --> 00:14:18,776
Okay, please don't
start now, Chloe.

211
00:14:18,943 --> 00:14:20,069
That is not helping.

212
00:14:20,153 --> 00:14:22,613
Max? Come on,
I'm your friend.

213
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:24,860
Okay? And as your friend,
I gotta be honest with you.

214
00:14:24,907 --> 00:14:26,826
I don't care about you
or your problems.

215
00:14:26,951 --> 00:14:28,453
But if you don't do something

216
00:14:28,619 --> 00:14:31,122
about this guy, and soon,

217
00:14:31,289 --> 00:14:34,125
your perfect little life
with your dumb, bleh, human

218
00:14:34,292 --> 00:14:36,461
is gonna be over, forever.

219
00:14:36,627 --> 00:14:37,962
Forever?

220
00:14:38,129 --> 00:14:40,048
Forever. Yeah,
that's what I just...

221
00:14:40,214 --> 00:14:43,509
Why is this mouse
on my paw still?

222
00:14:43,634 --> 00:14:47,055
Look, if you really
want to get your turf back

223
00:14:47,221 --> 00:14:49,283
you're gonna have to start
acting like the alpha dog.

224
00:14:49,307 --> 00:14:50,975
Right. Alpha dog.

225
00:14:51,142 --> 00:14:53,186
I can do that.

226
00:14:53,311 --> 00:14:54,896
Okay, okay.
Please don't go!

227
00:14:55,063 --> 00:14:56,355
This time,
really don't go.

228
00:14:56,481 --> 00:14:58,281
I'm running late.
I gotta go.
Wait, wait. Stay!

229
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:00,159
Stay for the trick.
"Spin!" I'm doing "spin."

230
00:15:00,234 --> 00:15:01,670
You guys be good.
I'll see you later.

231
00:15:01,694 --> 00:15:02,695
Wait. No, look...

232
00:15:02,862 --> 00:15:03,863
Okay, Max.

233
00:15:11,746 --> 00:15:14,707
Listen, Duke.
I'm not sure
if you're aware,

234
00:15:14,832 --> 00:15:18,336
but one of those
food bowls, technically...

235
00:15:18,503 --> 00:15:20,088
It's reserved for...

236
00:15:20,254 --> 00:15:22,924
I know, maybe
you didn't read
the names, but...

237
00:15:23,091 --> 00:15:24,342
That's my bowl.
Mmm.

238
00:15:26,886 --> 00:15:28,638
I know that it...
Hey...

239
00:15:28,763 --> 00:15:30,348
I was just thinking,
I don't know,

240
00:15:30,515 --> 00:15:32,517
maybe we could institute
some ground rules.

241
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,852
I just thought that...

242
00:15:34,977 --> 00:15:37,271
Or not.
I don't need a bowl.

243
00:15:37,355 --> 00:15:38,356
Here again?

244
00:15:38,523 --> 00:15:39,565
Rodent!
Ah!

245
00:15:49,158 --> 00:15:50,368
Oh, Duke.

246
00:15:50,535 --> 00:15:51,911
Duke, Katie is not...

247
00:15:52,078 --> 00:15:54,539
Katie's gonna be so upset
when she sees that.

248
00:15:54,705 --> 00:15:57,416
Katie's gonna flip out...

249
00:15:57,583 --> 00:16:00,920
When she sees
how you trashed her
whole place.

250
00:16:01,045 --> 00:16:03,339
Oh, it's just one vase.

251
00:16:03,464 --> 00:16:05,591
Is it, Duke? Is it?

252
00:16:06,217 --> 00:16:08,219
Oh, that's a shame.

253
00:16:11,013 --> 00:16:12,056
What are you doing?

254
00:16:12,181 --> 00:16:13,724
Whoa, what am I doing?

255
00:16:13,891 --> 00:16:16,644
Nothing.
I'm a cute little doggy.

256
00:16:16,811 --> 00:16:20,231
Katie knows I wouldn't
do anything like this.

257
00:16:20,398 --> 00:16:21,899
No, no. Whoa!

258
00:16:24,485 --> 00:16:25,486
Mmm.

259
00:16:25,570 --> 00:16:28,156
This could only be the work
of a dangerous stray,

260
00:16:28,823 --> 00:16:31,951
who hasn't laid down
a foundation of trust.

261
00:16:32,118 --> 00:16:33,244
You're the new dog.

262
00:16:33,995 --> 00:16:36,706
And, Duke, what'd you
go and do this for'?

263
00:16:38,416 --> 00:16:39,792
I'm gonna...
What? Bite me?

264
00:16:39,959 --> 00:16:41,460
Rip my face off?

265
00:16:41,586 --> 00:16:43,588
Perfect. Wait till
Katie finds out.

266
00:16:43,754 --> 00:16:46,257
Oh! Help, Katie!
Thank goodness
you're here.

267
00:16:46,424 --> 00:16:50,219
I tried to stop him,
but he's crazy!

268
00:16:52,805 --> 00:16:54,432
Now, sit.

269
00:16:54,557 --> 00:16:56,601
Okay, okay, okay.

270
00:16:58,936 --> 00:17:00,563
Lay down.

271
00:17:02,398 --> 00:17:04,150
Good boy.

272
00:17:19,957 --> 00:17:21,292
Hi, Max.

273
00:17:21,459 --> 00:17:22,627
Hey, Gidget.

274
00:17:22,793 --> 00:17:24,378
Who's your
new roommate?

275
00:17:24,503 --> 00:17:25,963
Is it a girl dog
or a boy dog?

276
00:17:26,130 --> 00:17:27,730
Not that I care.
It doesn't matter to me.

277
00:17:27,757 --> 00:17:30,176
Oh, that's nobody, Gidget.
He's just visiting.

278
00:17:30,301 --> 00:17:32,511
Yeah, he's gonna be
gone soon.

279
00:17:42,939 --> 00:17:44,106
Hey, what's up?

280
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:45,233
Oh, hi.

281
00:17:45,358 --> 00:17:47,193
Your hat
is the best hat
I've ever seen.

282
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,361
Hey.

283
00:17:48,486 --> 00:17:50,446
Uh, excuse me.
Genius!

284
00:17:50,613 --> 00:17:52,114
You forgot my leash.

285
00:17:53,324 --> 00:17:54,325
Never mind.

286
00:17:56,285 --> 00:17:57,870
Hey, fellas,
how's it...

287
00:17:58,996 --> 00:18:00,623
Hey, fellas,
how's it...

288
00:18:01,624 --> 00:18:03,125
Hey, fellas...

289
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:05,711
Oh, uh...
Say, Duke...

290
00:18:05,878 --> 00:18:07,004
Yes?

291
00:18:07,171 --> 00:18:09,840
Be a good lad and
bring me a stick,
won't you?

292
00:18:09,966 --> 00:18:14,136
It would please me
to chew on a stick
just now.

293
00:18:14,262 --> 00:18:16,681
You heard me. Fetch.

294
00:18:20,351 --> 00:18:22,186
Nah, nah, nah, nah.
Nah, not that one.

295
00:18:22,353 --> 00:18:24,188
That one doesn't
please me.

296
00:18:24,355 --> 00:18:25,856
Find a really
good one, Duke.

297
00:18:30,861 --> 00:18:32,863
Yeah, that's it.

298
00:18:38,995 --> 00:18:41,163
Hey, Max. Boy!
Oh, wow.

299
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:43,708
There are a ton of
sticks over here, Max!

300
00:18:43,833 --> 00:18:45,418
You should come over
and look at them.

301
00:18:45,584 --> 00:18:48,004
Yeah, I wanna
make sure I grab
you the right one.

302
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:50,464
Well, that's
very, uh, thoughtful.

303
00:18:53,634 --> 00:18:55,803
Look at all
these sticks!

304
00:18:57,263 --> 00:18:58,306
Whoa!

305
00:18:58,389 --> 00:19:00,599
Help! Help!

306
00:19:00,683 --> 00:19:02,184
Hey, did you
hear that?

307
00:19:02,768 --> 00:19:03,769
Butterfly!

308
00:19:03,894 --> 00:19:06,605
Butterfly!
Butterfly! Let's get it!

309
00:19:11,902 --> 00:19:13,154
Wha... What's...

310
00:19:23,497 --> 00:19:24,498
Huh?

311
00:19:30,796 --> 00:19:33,257
Whoa!

312
00:19:33,758 --> 00:19:34,967
Help! Help!

313
00:19:35,092 --> 00:19:36,093
So long!

314
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:37,428
Don't leave me here!

315
00:19:37,553 --> 00:19:39,347
Didn't have to
be this way, Max.

316
00:19:39,513 --> 00:19:40,681
Wait!
No hard feelings!

317
00:19:40,765 --> 00:19:41,766
Duke!

318
00:19:41,932 --> 00:19:43,017
Please!

319
00:19:43,684 --> 00:19:44,685
Oy!

320
00:19:44,769 --> 00:19:46,729
What's going on here?

321
00:19:46,854 --> 00:19:49,094
Mind your own business.
Oh, my gosh,
what happened to you?

322
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:50,608
I had a fight.
All right?

323
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:53,277
With a big,
stupid dog.

324
00:19:53,527 --> 00:19:54,570
He lost.

325
00:19:54,695 --> 00:19:58,574
Oh, you're headed into
dangerous territory
there, kitty-oat.

326
00:19:58,699 --> 00:20:00,868
I'd watch your tone,
sunshine.

327
00:20:00,993 --> 00:20:02,578
You know what
I'm gonna do?

328
00:20:02,703 --> 00:20:05,206
I'm gonna out you into
string, ball you up,

329
00:20:05,331 --> 00:20:07,958
and then bat you
around for hours

330
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:09,960
in a game that
only I understand.

331
00:20:10,044 --> 00:20:12,088
Oh, very nice.

332
00:20:12,171 --> 00:20:13,172
I'll take that!

333
00:20:13,339 --> 00:20:14,507
Wha...

334
00:20:17,134 --> 00:20:20,638
Ooh! Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

335
00:20:21,138 --> 00:20:22,765
You want to
start with me,
little raisin?

336
00:20:23,057 --> 00:20:24,433
Okay.

337
00:20:24,558 --> 00:20:26,143
Get your umbrellas
out, kitties,

338
00:20:26,268 --> 00:20:28,145
because here they come!

339
00:20:28,312 --> 00:20:30,940
The thunder
and the lightning!

340
00:20:31,107 --> 00:20:32,650
Right down on your face!

341
00:20:37,238 --> 00:20:39,615
Gosh, there are a lot
of you up there.

342
00:20:39,698 --> 00:20:41,927
I'm talking about
the thunder and the lightning
that's coming down

343
00:20:41,951 --> 00:20:44,245
on all of your
collective faces!

344
00:20:44,328 --> 00:20:45,329
Attack on three...

345
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,248
Two...

346
00:20:51,794 --> 00:20:53,921
I just remembered
I gotta be somewhere!

347
00:20:57,133 --> 00:20:59,635
That guy, huh? Am I right?

348
00:21:01,262 --> 00:21:03,472
Okay. You know what?
I'm just gonna...

349
00:21:03,639 --> 00:21:05,391
No offense, but good-bye!

350
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,521
Whoa!

351
00:21:13,149 --> 00:21:14,567
Whoa!

352
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:35,921
Hey!

353
00:21:36,714 --> 00:21:38,007
You little...

354
00:21:47,725 --> 00:21:48,726
Duke?

355
00:21:50,478 --> 00:21:51,729
You came back?

356
00:21:51,854 --> 00:21:52,897
Run!

357
00:21:57,568 --> 00:22:00,321
It's the po-po!
Scram!

358
00:22:09,413 --> 00:22:10,414
Wait!

359
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,087
Two, four,
six, eight...
Hmm...

360
00:22:17,838 --> 00:22:19,048
See you tomorrow,
Guillermo!

361
00:22:19,215 --> 00:22:20,382
You know it.

362
00:22:20,758 --> 00:22:21,926
Ten...

363
00:22:22,009 --> 00:22:23,052
Eh, okay.

364
00:22:23,677 --> 00:22:24,678
Right.

365
00:22:26,555 --> 00:22:27,556
Uh-huh.

366
00:22:27,765 --> 00:22:28,766
Sheez, did you see that?

367
00:22:28,849 --> 00:22:29,850
Yeah, I saw it.

368
00:22:29,934 --> 00:22:32,603
Throw it with your arm,
you lazy weirdo!

369
00:22:32,770 --> 00:22:35,231
- I would not fetch that.
- I'm old-school.

370
00:22:47,201 --> 00:22:48,452
Thanks a lot, Duke.

371
00:22:48,619 --> 00:22:49,819
I don't like to
use this phrase

372
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:51,705
because it's offensive
to our kind,

373
00:22:51,789 --> 00:22:53,791
but you are
a bad dog!

374
00:22:53,958 --> 00:22:55,459
Katie's not
going to like this.

375
00:22:55,626 --> 00:22:57,461
I can't go
to the pound.

376
00:22:58,963 --> 00:23:00,965
What? What's wrong
with you?

377
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:02,800
Well, Katie just...

378
00:23:02,967 --> 00:23:05,469
She just got me
out of the pound.

379
00:23:05,803 --> 00:23:07,721
And if I go back...

380
00:23:08,639 --> 00:23:10,933
Max, it's the end
of the line for me.

381
00:23:21,318 --> 00:23:22,319
Yes! Mmm...

382
00:23:23,195 --> 00:23:25,823
<i>Why? Why?</i>

383
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:27,449
What's the matter, Maria?

384
00:23:27,575 --> 00:23:29,118
<i>Maria, your face,</i>

385
00:23:29,201 --> 00:23:30,828
<i>it wears
a thousand sorrows.</i>

386
00:23:30,953 --> 00:23:32,663
<i>What is wrong?</i>

387
00:23:32,788 --> 00:23:34,290
<i>Oh, I have come
face-to-face</i>

388
00:23:34,373 --> 00:23:36,750
<i>with the worst thing
in the world.</i>

389
00:23:36,875 --> 00:23:39,795
What? Oh, tell me,
Maria. Tell me now!

390
00:23:39,962 --> 00:23:42,381
I cannot bear
another moment
without knowing!

391
00:23:42,548 --> 00:23:44,341
<i>Loneliness.</i>

392
00:23:48,012 --> 00:23:49,597
Max! Max!

393
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:51,515
Max? Huh?

394
00:23:52,349 --> 00:23:54,018
Hey, I see you,
squirrel!

395
00:23:54,143 --> 00:23:55,185
This is not
your area!

396
00:23:55,352 --> 00:23:56,437
We marked that tree!

397
00:23:58,230 --> 00:23:59,857
Don't you try
and hide!
I can see... Oh!

398
00:24:00,232 --> 00:24:01,358
What was that?

399
00:24:01,525 --> 00:24:03,360
How dare you!
Guys,
where's Max?

400
00:24:03,527 --> 00:24:05,613
Nobody likes you,
squirrels!

401
00:24:08,032 --> 00:24:10,367
Guys, seriously,
where is Max?

402
00:24:10,534 --> 00:24:12,202
Calm down, girl.
He's right...

403
00:24:12,828 --> 00:24:14,413
Huh. He is gone.

404
00:24:14,496 --> 00:24:15,497
Oh, it's fine.

405
00:24:15,664 --> 00:24:19,209
I heard him screaming
after he disappeared
into those bushes.

406
00:24:20,336 --> 00:24:22,254
Max is gone?

407
00:24:22,379 --> 00:24:25,049
This is bad.
This is so bad.

408
00:24:25,215 --> 00:24:27,509
<i>Maria, if he is
your true love</i>

409
00:24:27,593 --> 00:24:29,428
<i>you must go to him!</i>

410
00:24:29,553 --> 00:24:31,597
<i>Save him! Save him!</i>

411
00:24:32,222 --> 00:24:35,351
Yes! Yes!
Save my true love!

412
00:24:36,852 --> 00:24:38,062
I'm coming, Max!

413
00:24:49,281 --> 00:24:50,783
- Hi, Chloe.
- If anyone asks,

414
00:24:50,866 --> 00:24:52,868
I'm on my way to
the roof to look
for Max.

415
00:24:54,745 --> 00:24:55,829
Okay, bye-bye-

416
00:25:04,922 --> 00:25:06,590
Whoa. You see that?

417
00:25:07,257 --> 00:25:09,259
Yeah, give me
a second.

418
00:25:11,637 --> 00:25:13,806
Oh! Hey, there,
cute little bunny.

419
00:25:13,931 --> 00:25:16,600
VVhatcha doing in the
middle of the road?

420
00:25:24,108 --> 00:25:25,609
Bunny!

421
00:25:26,902 --> 00:25:28,320
What's going on?

422
00:25:29,196 --> 00:25:30,614
What the...

423
00:25:31,824 --> 00:25:33,075
Save yourself!

424
00:25:33,242 --> 00:25:34,410
Shut it, human!

425
00:25:34,493 --> 00:25:35,536
Let's do this!
Now!

426
00:25:35,661 --> 00:25:37,579
Now! Yeah!

427
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:40,249
Get off me!

428
00:25:44,628 --> 00:25:46,296
Wait up!

429
00:25:46,463 --> 00:25:48,173
Get off me, pig!

430
00:25:49,633 --> 00:25:50,843
Get off!

431
00:25:51,009 --> 00:25:52,302
Ow! Ow!

432
00:25:54,805 --> 00:25:56,932
Whoa...

433
00:26:00,644 --> 00:26:01,979
What's happening?

434
00:26:02,104 --> 00:26:03,105
I don't know!

435
00:26:06,483 --> 00:26:08,485
Ripper! Ripper,
where you at?

436
00:26:09,403 --> 00:26:11,989
- Let's go, Ripper!
- I'm busting you outta here!

437
00:26:17,536 --> 00:26:19,288
The revolution has begun!

438
00:26:19,455 --> 00:26:20,789
Liberated forever!

439
00:26:20,956 --> 00:26:22,666
Domesticated never!

440
00:26:22,833 --> 00:26:23,959
Yeah!

441
00:26:26,336 --> 00:26:28,422
Who's driving
this thing?

442
00:26:33,010 --> 00:26:34,178
Whoo!

443
00:26:49,526 --> 00:26:51,028
Ha, ha!

444
00:27:00,913 --> 00:27:03,081
Let's go! Let's go!
Let's go!

445
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:08,003
Who are you guys?

446
00:27:08,545 --> 00:27:09,755
Huh? Who are we?

447
00:27:09,922 --> 00:27:11,924
Who are we?

448
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:14,927
We are the Flushed Pets...

449
00:27:15,093 --> 00:27:16,553
Thrown away
by our owners

450
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,889
and now we are
out for revenge!

451
00:27:19,056 --> 00:27:20,224
It's like a club,

452
00:27:20,349 --> 00:27:21,975
but with biting
and scratching.

453
00:27:22,726 --> 00:27:24,061
Take us with you!

454
00:27:25,896 --> 00:27:27,606
I don't think so, pets.

455
00:27:27,773 --> 00:27:30,359
Yeah, you got the stench
of domestication all over you.

456
00:27:30,484 --> 00:27:33,320
You chose your side.
And now you're
gonna burn.

457
00:27:33,403 --> 00:27:35,739
No! Stop!
Who you calling "pets"?

458
00:27:35,906 --> 00:27:37,574
I ain't no pet!
You got it all wrong!

459
00:27:37,741 --> 00:27:40,244
We're just
like you guys.
We hate humans.

460
00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:42,120
Yeah! That's right!
Hate them.

461
00:27:42,287 --> 00:27:44,706
Oh, man, don't get me
started on people.
Am I right, Duke?

462
00:27:44,832 --> 00:27:47,251
Yeah, that's why we
burned our collars, man!

463
00:27:47,417 --> 00:27:48,919
We burned them
to the ground!

464
00:27:49,086 --> 00:27:50,254
And killed our owners!

465
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:52,140
Yeah... Wait a minute,
that's too far maybe?

466
00:27:52,256 --> 00:27:53,549
No, they dig it.

467
00:27:53,674 --> 00:27:55,151
Yes, we
whacked them.
Yeah, that's right!

468
00:27:55,175 --> 00:27:56,885
Bang, bang with
our own paws!

469
00:27:56,969 --> 00:27:59,012
If I had a dime
for every owner I killed...

470
00:27:59,096 --> 00:28:00,097
Oh, yeah!

471
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:01,348
I'd have a dime.

472
00:28:02,015 --> 00:28:03,642
Because I just
killed the one.

473
00:28:04,434 --> 00:28:06,019
<i>Ooh-whom.!</i>

474
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:08,105
Oh, y'all cold-blooded.

475
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:10,399
Oh, man, you remind me
of my boy, Ricky.

476
00:28:10,607 --> 00:28:11,817
He died, though.

477
00:28:11,984 --> 00:28:13,652
RIP, Ricky!

478
00:28:14,278 --> 00:28:17,155
The truth is, the struggle
could use some more muscle.

479
00:28:17,322 --> 00:28:18,633
All right, look,
I'll tell you what.

480
00:28:18,657 --> 00:28:20,593
We'll bust the both
of you out of here.
But understand this.

481
00:28:20,617 --> 00:28:21,952
From now on,
you work for me.

482
00:28:22,119 --> 00:28:23,954
That's fine.
Sounds like
a fun challenge.

483
00:28:26,790 --> 00:28:28,667
All right, guys,
let's do this!

484
00:28:32,337 --> 00:28:33,589
To the sewers!

485
00:28:34,172 --> 00:28:35,465
The sewers?

486
00:28:35,632 --> 00:28:38,343
What are
y'all waiting for?
I'm not playing.

487
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:39,678
I said...

488
00:28:39,845 --> 00:28:41,346
To the sewers!

489
00:28:48,687 --> 00:28:51,773
Long live
the revolution, suckers!

490
00:28:56,486 --> 00:28:57,863
I can do it.

491
00:29:01,742 --> 00:29:02,743
Oh!

492
00:29:03,952 --> 00:29:05,370
Max?

493
00:29:05,996 --> 00:29:07,164
Max?

494
00:29:07,372 --> 00:29:08,373
Max.

495
00:29:08,457 --> 00:29:09,458
Max.

496
00:29:09,583 --> 00:29:10,667
Max.

497
00:29:10,751 --> 00:29:11,752
Max.

498
00:29:11,877 --> 00:29:12,961
Max.

499
00:29:25,682 --> 00:29:27,684
Oh, where are you, Max?

500
00:29:29,895 --> 00:29:32,564
Looks like
you could use a little help.

501
00:29:32,731 --> 00:29:33,982
Who said that?

502
00:29:34,149 --> 00:29:35,359
Over here.

503
00:29:35,525 --> 00:29:38,403
In this dark and
foreboding shed.

504
00:29:46,370 --> 00:29:47,412
Uh...

505
00:29:47,496 --> 00:29:48,705
Hello?

506
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:51,083
I can see for miles.

507
00:29:51,249 --> 00:29:54,336
If you let me out,
I'll find your friend.

508
00:29:54,461 --> 00:29:55,712
Wow! Really?

509
00:29:55,879 --> 00:29:57,881
Oh! You're so sweet.

510
00:29:58,048 --> 00:29:59,883
You're sweet, too.

511
00:30:00,968 --> 00:30:02,260
Thanks, stranger.

512
00:30:02,427 --> 00:30:03,804
But not too sweet.

513
00:30:03,929 --> 00:30:07,391
There's also a salty,
gamey thing going on.

514
00:30:07,557 --> 00:30:08,767
Yeah, that's me.

515
00:30:08,934 --> 00:30:11,353
Come on, let's get you
out of that shed.

516
00:30:11,937 --> 00:30:13,397
Yeah, that's it.

517
00:30:13,563 --> 00:30:15,607
Just step over
the pile of bones.

518
00:30:15,732 --> 00:30:18,193
Pile of bones.
Okay, will do.

519
00:30:18,318 --> 00:30:20,404
I sure hope
Max is safe.

520
00:30:20,529 --> 00:30:22,614
You're a very
thoughtful food.

521
00:30:22,781 --> 00:30:25,283
"Food"? I didn't say that.
I said "friend."

522
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:27,411
I meant food...

523
00:30:27,577 --> 00:30:28,704
Ff lend.

524
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:29,997
You know what I meant.

525
00:30:30,122 --> 00:30:32,624
I'm sure lucky
I found you, uh...

526
00:30:32,791 --> 00:30:33,959
Tiberius.

527
00:30:34,084 --> 00:30:36,211
And, yes, this is
a very good thing for you,

528
00:30:36,378 --> 00:30:38,922
this whole
"meeting me" thing.

529
00:30:39,089 --> 00:30:41,008
Take off my hood.

530
00:30:52,853 --> 00:30:53,979
Ah!

531
00:30:54,062 --> 00:30:55,063
The chain!

532
00:30:56,982 --> 00:30:58,984
Oh! You tried
to eat me!

533
00:30:59,109 --> 00:31:00,444
I'm sorry.

534
00:31:01,069 --> 00:31:03,780
You should be sorry.
You deserve
to be looked up.

535
00:31:03,947 --> 00:31:05,532
You're a bad,
bad bird.

536
00:31:05,657 --> 00:31:08,702
I can't help it.
I was born with
killer instincts.

537
00:31:08,827 --> 00:31:10,328
That is just
no excuse.

538
00:31:10,495 --> 00:31:13,165
You're right.
Even for a predator,
I'm selfish.

539
00:31:13,331 --> 00:31:15,584
I'm a selfish predator.

540
00:31:15,751 --> 00:31:17,627
It's no wonder
I have no friends.

541
00:31:17,794 --> 00:31:19,004
Nobody.

542
00:31:20,672 --> 00:31:22,299
This is hopeless.

543
00:31:22,966 --> 00:31:24,634
Oh, don't...
There's no need
to cry.

544
00:31:24,801 --> 00:31:26,845
I'm sorry
that I yelled
at you before.

545
00:31:26,970 --> 00:31:28,680
Please, take off
the chain.

546
00:31:28,847 --> 00:31:31,475
This time I'll help
you. I promise.

547
00:31:32,601 --> 00:31:33,643
Tiberius...

548
00:31:33,810 --> 00:31:37,105
This is gonna
sound completely
horrible, but, um...

549
00:31:37,272 --> 00:31:38,857
I don't fully
trust you.

550
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:43,153
Oh, no, no, no...

551
00:31:43,278 --> 00:31:45,405
But, I guess
everyone deserves
a second chance.

552
00:31:45,572 --> 00:31:47,407
And you are just
a lonely, old bird.

553
00:31:47,574 --> 00:31:48,825
And you do have
weird manners

554
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:51,161
because you live
in a weird shed
on a roof.

555
00:31:51,328 --> 00:31:54,581
So, I'll tell you what.
If you find Max...

556
00:31:55,123 --> 00:31:56,750
I'll be your
best friend.

557
00:31:56,917 --> 00:31:58,919
Best friend?

558
00:31:59,169 --> 00:32:00,837
You and me?

559
00:32:01,296 --> 00:32:03,340
Whoa!

560
00:32:10,097 --> 00:32:11,348
Whoo!

561
00:32:18,522 --> 00:32:20,857
Yes!
That sounds nice.

562
00:32:21,024 --> 00:32:22,109
Let's do this.

563
00:32:22,234 --> 00:32:23,944
Okay.

564
00:32:25,529 --> 00:32:26,696
Ah...

565
00:32:30,117 --> 00:32:32,452
So, what does
this Max look like?

566
00:32:32,577 --> 00:32:33,578
Brown and white.

567
00:32:33,703 --> 00:32:36,540
He's a short-hair,
roguishly handsome.

568
00:32:36,706 --> 00:32:38,291
He's got a sparkle
in his eye.

569
00:32:38,416 --> 00:32:40,252
He sounds dreamy.

570
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:42,963
You have no idea.

571
00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:45,507
I mean, what?
Whatever. Shut up.

572
00:32:45,674 --> 00:32:46,675
Mmm-mmm.

573
00:32:47,884 --> 00:32:49,136
If my owner comes

574
00:32:49,261 --> 00:32:51,763
put on the hood and
pretend to be me.

575
00:32:51,972 --> 00:32:53,390
Okay, thank you!

576
00:33:03,233 --> 00:33:04,442
Ugh!

577
00:33:04,526 --> 00:33:06,403
The smell is disgusting...

578
00:33:07,571 --> 00:33:08,738
...-ly good.

579
00:33:08,905 --> 00:33:10,365
This is all so great.

580
00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:11,908
Love it here.

581
00:33:21,418 --> 00:33:22,502
What's...
The...

582
00:33:22,586 --> 00:33:24,546
Pass...
Word?

583
00:33:24,671 --> 00:33:26,089
Password?

584
00:33:26,256 --> 00:33:27,424
Look! Look at me.

585
00:33:27,591 --> 00:33:29,217
I am your leader.

586
00:33:29,384 --> 00:33:32,095
The leader does not
recite the password.

587
00:33:32,262 --> 00:33:34,431
The leader makes up
the password, idiots.

588
00:33:34,598 --> 00:33:36,558
Everybody, I'm making up
a new password right now.

589
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,059
The new password is...

590
00:33:38,226 --> 00:33:40,937
"Don't ask the leader
for the password!"

591
00:33:43,106 --> 00:33:44,608
Follow me.

592
00:33:51,615 --> 00:33:54,534
Welcome to the
underbelly, brothers.

593
00:33:54,701 --> 00:33:57,120
Home of the Flushed Pets.

594
00:34:19,809 --> 00:34:21,144
Brothers and
sisters!

595
00:34:21,228 --> 00:34:22,270
As you see,

596
00:34:22,395 --> 00:34:25,815
I've returned from
the surface with
two new recruits.

597
00:34:25,941 --> 00:34:28,485
These guys are
owner-killers!

598
00:34:30,612 --> 00:34:31,613
Hey, hey!
Settle down!

599
00:34:32,822 --> 00:34:35,492
Guys, I want you
to tell them
how you did it.

600
00:34:35,659 --> 00:34:36,886
Go ahead. Tell them
the whole story

601
00:34:36,910 --> 00:34:38,328
about how you
took out your owner.

602
00:34:38,495 --> 00:34:39,621
Don't leave out nothing.

603
00:34:39,746 --> 00:34:41,248
We love gory detail, here.

604
00:34:41,414 --> 00:34:42,832
Oh, yeah!
Tell us!

605
00:34:42,958 --> 00:34:44,751
Right.
So, tell them, Max.

606
00:34:44,918 --> 00:34:46,628
Okay, so.
I was like...

607
00:34:46,795 --> 00:34:47,796
Well, we were like...

608
00:34:47,963 --> 00:34:49,130
Take that!
Yeah!

609
00:34:49,297 --> 00:34:50,632
Stupid owner.

610
00:34:50,799 --> 00:34:52,676
So, that's who
you're dealing with.

611
00:34:54,511 --> 00:34:56,096
That story bored me
to death.

612
00:34:56,263 --> 00:34:57,347
Boring!

613
00:34:57,514 --> 00:34:58,765
Give us detail!

614
00:34:58,890 --> 00:35:00,600
Okay. Max?

615
00:35:00,767 --> 00:35:02,352
Okay, well, uh...

616
00:35:02,519 --> 00:35:04,479
So, there's
this thing
in the kitchen...

617
00:35:04,604 --> 00:35:05,689
Yeah. Table!

618
00:35:05,772 --> 00:35:07,190
It's flat.
Toaster!

619
00:35:07,399 --> 00:35:09,234
And then round on
just the end of it.

620
00:35:09,317 --> 00:35:10,360
A Spoon?

621
00:35:10,485 --> 00:35:11,987
Yes, a spoon!
Exactly.

622
00:35:12,112 --> 00:35:13,989
You can't hurt
someone with a spoon.

623
00:35:14,155 --> 00:35:15,865
You scoop with a spoon.

624
00:35:16,032 --> 00:35:17,033
How many people
wanna know

625
00:35:17,117 --> 00:35:18,261
how to kill somebody
with a spoon?

626
00:35:18,285 --> 00:35:20,161
I do! Oh, yeah!

627
00:35:20,287 --> 00:35:21,788
Okay. Uh, well...

628
00:35:21,955 --> 00:35:23,540
We used the spoon...

629
00:35:23,707 --> 00:35:26,334
Hit a button
on the machine
on the counter...

630
00:35:26,501 --> 00:35:27,979
Right, and it's
got those...
The, uh, you know.

631
00:35:28,003 --> 00:35:29,603
Those blades.
The, uh... It's got blades!

632
00:35:29,713 --> 00:35:31,172
Was it a blender?

633
00:35:32,382 --> 00:35:34,217
You blended somebody?

634
00:35:34,884 --> 00:35:36,244
He talking about
the blender, guys.

635
00:35:36,386 --> 00:35:38,138
Oh, please, tell me
it was a blender!

636
00:35:38,263 --> 00:35:40,724
Hey, buddy, I don't
ask what it's called,
we just kill with it.

637
00:35:40,890 --> 00:35:42,267
But it was a blender.

638
00:35:42,684 --> 00:35:44,352
Whoo! Do y'all hear this?

639
00:35:44,519 --> 00:35:46,730
You know who was
like this? Ricky!

640
00:35:47,731 --> 00:35:49,065
Rest in peace!

641
00:35:49,232 --> 00:35:51,526
Ricky was the
only soldier I had

642
00:35:51,693 --> 00:35:54,154
that was ready to
kill humans on sight.

643
00:35:54,321 --> 00:35:56,197
Everybody else
need a pep talk.

644
00:35:56,364 --> 00:35:57,949
Not these two brothers.

645
00:36:00,869 --> 00:36:04,706
See, all of us
have suffered at
the hands of man.

646
00:36:04,789 --> 00:36:06,082
I mean, take me for instance.

647
00:36:06,249 --> 00:36:08,668
I was a magician's rabbit
for kids' parties.

648
00:36:08,918 --> 00:36:12,088
But then bunny tricks
went out of style.

649
00:36:12,213 --> 00:36:13,423
So, what did
my owner do?

650
00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:15,091
My owner went and
left magic behind

651
00:36:15,175 --> 00:36:16,634
and made me disappear...

652
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:18,553
From his life!

653
00:36:18,762 --> 00:36:19,763
Uh-huh.

654
00:36:20,013 --> 00:36:21,848
I lived
in a tattoo parlor!

655
00:36:22,015 --> 00:36:24,601
The trainees used
to practice on me!

656
00:36:24,768 --> 00:36:26,770
Until they ran out
of space!

657
00:36:28,063 --> 00:36:30,106
I mean, yes,
humans say they love us.

658
00:36:30,273 --> 00:36:32,650
But then they turn around
and throw us out like garbage.

659
00:36:32,776 --> 00:36:34,652
Ain't that right,
Sea-Monkeys?

660
00:36:34,778 --> 00:36:37,197
It's not our fault
we don't look
like the ad!

661
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,281
Yeah!

662
00:36:38,907 --> 00:36:41,910
All right, you guys
are joining the brotherhood.

663
00:36:42,077 --> 00:36:43,787
- It's initiation time!
- Oh, yeah!

664
00:36:43,912 --> 00:36:45,622
The what?
I'm sorry,
what time?

665
00:36:45,789 --> 00:36:48,375
Summon the Viper!

666
00:36:51,461 --> 00:36:52,921
Uh, is this
Viper poisonous?

667
00:36:53,088 --> 00:36:55,757
Because I should
warn you, I'm very
allergic to poison!

668
00:37:02,514 --> 00:37:03,640
Ow!

669
00:37:05,558 --> 00:37:07,519
All right.
Show her!

670
00:37:13,733 --> 00:37:14,943
Max's collar!

671
00:37:15,110 --> 00:37:16,486
Where is he?

672
00:37:16,736 --> 00:37:18,154
What happened to him?

673
00:37:18,321 --> 00:37:19,948
I ain't saying
nothing!

674
00:37:20,824 --> 00:37:22,617
You're gonna tell
us where Max is.

675
00:37:22,784 --> 00:37:24,702
And you're gonna
tell us now!

676
00:37:26,454 --> 00:37:27,956
Is this supposed
to scare me?

677
00:37:28,123 --> 00:37:30,291
I'm a cat.
I land on my feet.

678
00:37:30,417 --> 00:37:31,418
Does it always happen?

679
00:37:31,501 --> 00:37:34,003
Because your head
looks like it's taken
a lot of landings.

680
00:37:34,170 --> 00:37:35,171
Do you want me
to cut you?

681
00:37:35,338 --> 00:37:37,898
Because I'll cut you
this way and that.
You'll look like a waffle.

682
00:37:39,092 --> 00:37:40,135
Okay.

683
00:37:40,301 --> 00:37:42,595
He's too stupid
to talk, and
too ugly to eat.

684
00:37:44,472 --> 00:37:46,057
I'm done
playing nice!

685
00:37:46,224 --> 00:37:48,143
Where is Max?

686
00:37:48,268 --> 00:37:49,644
OW.

687
00:37:49,853 --> 00:37:50,854
Tell me!

688
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:52,689
Ooh!

689
00:37:52,856 --> 00:37:53,940
Let me finish... Ow!

690
00:37:54,774 --> 00:37:56,067
Help me! Ow!

691
00:37:56,192 --> 00:37:58,153
Don't look at him.
Look at me.

692
00:37:58,319 --> 00:37:59,904
Nobody can help you!

693
00:38:00,029 --> 00:38:02,532
Where is Max?

694
00:38:02,657 --> 00:38:03,741
Okay! Okay!

695
00:38:03,908 --> 00:38:05,910
He's in the sewers!
He got taken!

696
00:38:06,035 --> 00:38:07,245
Please! Have mercy...

697
00:38:07,412 --> 00:38:09,914
Adorable puffy dog!

698
00:38:10,248 --> 00:38:12,333
Snake bite!
Snake bite! Snake bite!

699
00:38:25,096 --> 00:38:26,973
As proof of your
allegiance

700
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:28,725
you will now
receive the bite

701
00:38:28,892 --> 00:38:31,561
of a one-fanged,
half-blind Viper

702
00:38:31,728 --> 00:38:33,104
fueled by a diet

703
00:38:33,229 --> 00:38:36,691
of anti-human rage!

704
00:38:56,544 --> 00:38:58,213
Who wants
to go first?

705
00:38:58,338 --> 00:39:00,256
Uh... Okay,
here's the thing, though.

706
00:39:01,257 --> 00:39:02,258
Tiny Dog.

707
00:39:03,051 --> 00:39:04,344
Can I call you
"Tiny Dog"?

708
00:39:04,511 --> 00:39:06,387
It fits you.
Let's admit that.

709
00:39:06,554 --> 00:39:07,555
Look.

710
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:09,933
Between you
and the fat dog,
I like you the best.

711
00:39:10,099 --> 00:39:11,267
Oh, thank you!

712
00:39:11,434 --> 00:39:13,269
Tiny Dog's
gonna go first.

713
00:39:13,436 --> 00:39:15,063
Everybody,
TD's going first!

714
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:16,231
No, no, no.

715
00:39:16,356 --> 00:39:18,900
Tiny Dog does not
want to go first.
Take the fat dog!

716
00:39:18,983 --> 00:39:20,068
Snake bite!

717
00:39:20,193 --> 00:39:22,445
No, no, no.
Stop!

718
00:39:22,570 --> 00:39:25,782
Snake bite!
Snake bite! Snake bite!

719
00:39:25,907 --> 00:39:27,283
No, no, no, no.

720
00:39:28,368 --> 00:39:30,203
Stop!

721
00:39:30,787 --> 00:39:33,998
What are you doing
initiating a couple
domestics?

722
00:39:34,123 --> 00:39:35,166
Domestics?

723
00:39:35,291 --> 00:39:37,126
Yeah. We just jumped
those two in the alley.

724
00:39:37,293 --> 00:39:39,087
Slashed off their collars.

725
00:39:39,254 --> 00:39:40,838
No, no, no.
That's not true.

726
00:39:40,964 --> 00:39:42,298
You said you
burned your collars.

727
00:39:42,423 --> 00:39:45,218
Well, "burned," "lost,"
"had them stolen by cats."

728
00:39:45,385 --> 00:39:47,762
It's all just words,
really, isn't it?

729
00:39:47,887 --> 00:39:50,348
You don't deserve to
be marked by the Viper.

730
00:39:50,473 --> 00:39:52,308
Oh, no.
We'll just show
ourselves out.

731
00:39:52,433 --> 00:39:53,601
You deserve

732
00:39:53,768 --> 00:39:55,645
to be eaten
by the Viper.

733
00:39:55,812 --> 00:39:57,605
Get those leash lovers!

734
00:40:03,653 --> 00:40:04,988
Hold on.

735
00:40:12,579 --> 00:40:14,163
Go get them,
Duke. Whoa!

736
00:40:22,797 --> 00:40:24,716
On...

737
00:40:51,576 --> 00:40:54,495
Uh, fellas, that
was an accident.

738
00:40:54,621 --> 00:40:57,373
You squished
the sacred Viper!

739
00:40:57,707 --> 00:40:59,584
He's a flapjack.

740
00:41:00,209 --> 00:41:01,628
Oh, Viper!

741
00:41:02,211 --> 00:41:04,297
Viper, you in a better place!

742
00:41:04,422 --> 00:41:05,506
You and Ricky!

743
00:41:10,678 --> 00:41:13,014
You ain't never did
nothing to nobody!

744
00:41:13,181 --> 00:41:14,682
Well, you bit a lot
of people, Viper.

745
00:41:14,849 --> 00:41:16,769
So, technically, you might
actually deserve this.

746
00:41:16,809 --> 00:41:19,145
This might be something
that was long overdue.

747
00:41:20,021 --> 00:41:22,899
But it shouldn't
have came like this.
Not on my watch.

748
00:41:23,066 --> 00:41:24,692
Get them!

749
00:41:26,778 --> 00:41:28,154
Oh, no!

750
00:41:28,279 --> 00:41:30,323
Come on!

751
00:41:47,090 --> 00:41:48,800
Ah! Wait up, Duke!

752
00:41:49,717 --> 00:41:52,178
Hyah!

753
00:41:53,346 --> 00:41:55,765
We're sorry. Can this be
over now?

754
00:41:56,933 --> 00:41:58,017
We've got a problem.

755
00:41:58,101 --> 00:41:59,477
We have so
many problems.

756
00:41:59,602 --> 00:42:01,771
Which one do you
mean at this moment?

757
00:42:06,901 --> 00:42:08,528
Stop running, dummies!

758
00:42:08,695 --> 00:42:09,946
Stop it right now!

759
00:42:10,071 --> 00:42:12,448
Hold your breath!
Hold my breath? Ah!

760
00:42:18,287 --> 00:42:19,455
Get them!

761
00:42:22,959 --> 00:42:26,713
This is my least
favorite part of this
whole thing so far!

762
00:42:42,145 --> 00:42:43,146
Ff lends!

763
00:42:43,312 --> 00:42:46,441
I am afraid that
I have some
terrible news.

764
00:42:46,566 --> 00:42:48,443
The squirrels
are gonna take
over the world!

765
00:42:48,609 --> 00:42:49,610
I knew it!

766
00:42:49,736 --> 00:42:52,822
I always said,
squirrels are little
shifty little guys.

767
00:42:52,947 --> 00:42:55,450
No. We're not doing
the squirrel thing
right now. That's not...

768
00:42:55,616 --> 00:42:56,617
No!

769
00:42:56,951 --> 00:42:58,745
Max is missing!

770
00:42:58,870 --> 00:43:00,580
He's out there somewhere.

771
00:43:00,747 --> 00:43:02,373
Lost. Scared.

772
00:43:02,498 --> 00:43:04,167
So, so handsome.

773
00:43:04,333 --> 00:43:06,753
We have got to find him
and bring him home!

774
00:43:06,878 --> 00:43:09,672
But the outside world
is loud and scary.

775
00:43:09,797 --> 00:43:10,965
Ooh! Is that a hawk?

776
00:43:11,716 --> 00:43:14,761
This is
my friend, Tiberius.
He's going to help us.

777
00:43:15,344 --> 00:43:17,638
He's not going to eat us.
We've already been over it.

778
00:43:17,805 --> 00:43:19,765
Come on, Gidget.
We go out there
without a leash...

779
00:43:19,891 --> 00:43:21,601
We'll get
caught by a net.

780
00:43:21,684 --> 00:43:22,685
Or something worse!

781
00:43:22,852 --> 00:43:24,353
Yeah, like a hawk!

782
00:43:24,479 --> 00:43:27,356
We're wasting time!
Max needs us!

783
00:43:27,523 --> 00:43:29,942
Come on, girl,
Max doesn't even
know you're alive.

784
00:43:30,067 --> 00:43:31,319
Well, I don't care!

785
00:43:31,486 --> 00:43:33,863
I love him! I love him
with all of my heart!

786
00:43:34,030 --> 00:43:37,408
And I'm gonna go look for Max,
no matter who's with me.

787
00:43:37,575 --> 00:43:38,701
So...

788
00:43:38,868 --> 00:43:40,036
Who's with me?

789
00:43:45,958 --> 00:43:48,085
All right, fine. Fine.

790
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:50,713
Oh, come on, guys.

791
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:52,673
I can't believe you.

792
00:43:52,799 --> 00:43:55,259
When I got my claws
caught in the curtains

793
00:43:55,426 --> 00:43:57,178
who pulled me down?

794
00:43:57,345 --> 00:43:58,721
Max did.

795
00:43:59,263 --> 00:44:00,848
Buddy, Mel.

796
00:44:00,973 --> 00:44:04,060
When you were fixed,
who taught you to sit
the comfortable way?

797
00:44:04,185 --> 00:44:05,228
Max did!

798
00:44:05,394 --> 00:44:06,562
Max did!

799
00:44:06,729 --> 00:44:08,022
Max did.
He did it!

800
00:44:08,147 --> 00:44:11,067
And when that random cat
tried to eat Sweetpea

801
00:44:11,234 --> 00:44:12,985
who saved him?

802
00:44:13,110 --> 00:44:15,112
- It wasn't a random cat.
- It was you.

803
00:44:15,822 --> 00:44:17,865
The identity of
the random cat
is not the point.

804
00:44:18,032 --> 00:44:20,326
We're talking
about who saved him!

805
00:44:20,451 --> 00:44:21,452
Max did!

806
00:44:21,577 --> 00:44:24,080
We gotta save him.
We gotta go save Max!
Yeah!

807
00:44:25,748 --> 00:44:28,376
Yeah! Let's go
save Max!

808
00:44:29,085 --> 00:44:30,586
Uh, which one
is Max, again?

809
00:44:32,296 --> 00:44:33,339
Um...

810
00:44:33,422 --> 00:44:34,924
Tiberius!

811
00:44:35,091 --> 00:44:37,051
No! Bad, bad bird.

812
00:44:37,510 --> 00:44:40,429
Nice little guy.

813
00:44:40,596 --> 00:44:42,181
Nice little guy.

814
00:44:42,306 --> 00:44:43,599
I like this bird.

815
00:44:44,225 --> 00:44:45,601
Crazy bird.

816
00:45:17,633 --> 00:45:18,759
Come on!

817
00:45:18,926 --> 00:45:20,136
We gotta get to shore.

818
00:45:20,303 --> 00:45:23,472
I only know the doggy paddle!
And I don't know it well!

819
00:45:24,307 --> 00:45:26,767
Swim, Tiny Dog.
Swim!

820
00:45:36,819 --> 00:45:38,029
Duke!

821
00:45:41,073 --> 00:45:42,950
Help!

822
00:45:48,289 --> 00:45:49,832
Max, grab the ring!

823
00:45:50,666 --> 00:45:51,834
I can't!

824
00:45:52,001 --> 00:45:53,127
Keep it up, Max!

825
00:45:53,252 --> 00:45:54,253
You're doing...

826
00:45:54,337 --> 00:45:56,172
Well, you're not
doing great.

827
00:45:56,339 --> 00:45:58,341
But you're not drowning,
and that's something!

828
00:46:05,890 --> 00:46:07,308
You're almost there!

829
00:46:21,322 --> 00:46:22,531
Thanks, Duke.

830
00:46:23,157 --> 00:46:24,492
No problem.

831
00:46:24,659 --> 00:46:27,036
Finally.
I'm going home.

832
00:46:27,453 --> 00:46:28,454
Oh.

833
00:46:28,537 --> 00:46:30,539
Isn't home that way?

834
00:46:32,208 --> 00:46:33,793
Ah! Seriously?

835
00:46:44,095 --> 00:46:45,429
They're going
to Brooklyn.

836
00:46:45,596 --> 00:46:48,057
They say everyone's
going to Brooklyn
these days.

837
00:46:48,224 --> 00:46:49,850
It's making
a real comeback.

838
00:46:49,976 --> 00:46:52,186
I'm not talking about
hipster real estate trends.

839
00:46:52,353 --> 00:46:54,605
I'm talking about
vengeance, Tattoo!

840
00:46:54,730 --> 00:46:56,899
Death is coming
to Brooklyn.

841
00:46:57,066 --> 00:46:58,442
And it's got buck teeth

842
00:46:58,609 --> 00:47:00,152
and a cotton tail.

843
00:47:19,130 --> 00:47:20,589
<i>Let' s go!</i>

844
00:47:35,688 --> 00:47:36,939
Whee!

845
00:47:39,191 --> 00:47:40,693
Hi, how are you?

846
00:47:40,818 --> 00:47:42,319
Hi, how are you?

847
00:47:43,946 --> 00:47:45,740
Chug! Chug! Chug!

848
00:48:00,463 --> 00:48:02,631
What is this crazy joint?

849
00:48:02,757 --> 00:48:04,467
This is Pops' place.

850
00:48:04,633 --> 00:48:07,636
His owner is never home,
so it's kind of a hot spot.

851
00:48:07,803 --> 00:48:09,680
Pops knows everyone
in this city.

852
00:48:09,847 --> 00:48:13,267
If he agrees to help us,
Max is as good as found.

853
00:48:13,434 --> 00:48:14,852
Cool!
Fabulous!

854
00:48:49,178 --> 00:48:50,387
Tell me
you got that!

855
00:48:50,846 --> 00:48:52,014
Oh, heck yes, I did.

856
00:48:52,181 --> 00:48:54,016
What's up, Peanut?
Hey, Buddy.

857
00:48:54,183 --> 00:48:55,643
You see Pops
around here?

858
00:48:55,810 --> 00:48:57,561
Yeah, he's over there.

859
00:48:59,021 --> 00:49:00,022
Hey, Pops.

860
00:49:00,189 --> 00:49:01,190
Mud and sweet potatoes.

861
00:49:01,357 --> 00:49:02,399
Pops!

862
00:49:02,608 --> 00:49:04,735
Who's that? What?

863
00:49:04,944 --> 00:49:06,821
Oh,
hey, Buddy.

864
00:49:07,404 --> 00:49:08,823
How you been,
old-timer?

865
00:49:09,490 --> 00:49:10,825
Paralyzed.

866
00:49:12,409 --> 00:49:14,078
Great! Listen,
Mr. Pops,

867
00:49:14,245 --> 00:49:15,871
our friend Max
was taken.

868
00:49:16,038 --> 00:49:18,165
Last we heard,
he was lost in the sewers.

869
00:49:18,290 --> 00:49:21,710
Buddy said that
maybe you could
help us.

870
00:49:21,836 --> 00:49:25,047
You know, I do know
a guy in the sewers,

871
00:49:25,256 --> 00:49:26,298
but, ah,

872
00:49:26,382 --> 00:49:27,925
I don't
go out anymore.

873
00:49:28,050 --> 00:49:29,844
What a waste of time.

874
00:49:29,969 --> 00:49:31,095
Who said that?

875
00:49:31,220 --> 00:49:32,513
Oh, I said it.

876
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:34,390
By the way,
I meant no offense,
I just...

877
00:49:34,557 --> 00:49:35,891
Have you seen yourself?

878
00:49:36,058 --> 00:49:37,560
Welly-well,
well, well...

879
00:49:37,768 --> 00:49:40,229
Looky what we
apparently have here.

880
00:49:40,396 --> 00:49:43,107
Meezy would like
to have a look-see.

881
00:49:43,274 --> 00:49:45,401
Myron! Brows!

882
00:49:47,611 --> 00:49:48,821
Oh, no.

883
00:49:48,946 --> 00:49:50,197
Oh, yes.

884
00:49:50,364 --> 00:49:52,575
Me like what me see.

885
00:49:52,741 --> 00:49:54,368
Well, what me can see.

886
00:49:54,535 --> 00:49:56,412
It's all
an attractive blur.

887
00:49:56,704 --> 00:49:58,789
Uh...
Little lady,
this is my city.

888
00:49:58,956 --> 00:50:00,749
I'll find your friend.

889
00:50:00,916 --> 00:50:03,085
All right,
party's over!

890
00:50:03,252 --> 00:50:04,753
Myron! Vacuum!

891
00:50:10,092 --> 00:50:13,095
So, where are
you from, my
fuzzy angel?

892
00:50:13,262 --> 00:50:14,930
Dude, I'm a cat.

893
00:50:15,097 --> 00:50:17,099
Well, nobody's perfect.

894
00:50:24,773 --> 00:50:27,943
I'm so hungry.

895
00:50:31,155 --> 00:50:34,200
Oh, man. Would you
look at that sandwich!

896
00:50:34,325 --> 00:50:36,827
All right.
Time to work
the gift.

897
00:50:44,793 --> 00:50:47,004
No, no, no!

898
00:50:51,133 --> 00:50:54,094
Okay,
this'll be fine.
We're fine.

899
00:50:54,178 --> 00:50:55,638
We can find our way home.

900
00:50:55,804 --> 00:50:58,098
We are descended
from the mighty wolf!

901
00:50:58,265 --> 00:51:00,267
We have raw, primal instincts

902
00:51:00,434 --> 00:51:02,353
that are mere
moments away

903
00:51:02,436 --> 00:51:04,897
from kicking in
and leading us home!

904
00:51:05,022 --> 00:51:06,690
I cannot wait!

905
00:51:06,857 --> 00:51:08,776
Here it comes!

906
00:51:09,193 --> 00:51:10,819
Anything?

907
00:51:10,986 --> 00:51:11,987
No.

908
00:51:12,112 --> 00:51:13,656
Wait! Oh, I...

909
00:51:13,989 --> 00:51:15,824
No.

910
00:51:15,991 --> 00:51:17,743
I don't
know, Duke.

911
00:51:17,910 --> 00:51:21,497
Maybe the legend
of dogs coming from
wolves is just wrong.

912
00:51:21,664 --> 00:51:24,750
Maybe one puppy asked his mom,
"Where did we come from?"

913
00:51:24,875 --> 00:51:26,168
And the mom said,
"Woof."

914
00:51:26,335 --> 00:51:28,003
And the kid was
like "Oh, wolves?"

915
00:51:28,170 --> 00:51:29,838
And she was like,
"Yeah, fine."

916
00:51:30,005 --> 00:51:31,173
Sausage.

917
00:51:31,257 --> 00:51:33,842
Huh?
You smell that?

918
00:51:34,176 --> 00:51:36,095
Oh, man, it is.

919
00:51:36,220 --> 00:51:37,805
Sausage!

920
00:51:37,930 --> 00:51:39,598
Well, then,
what are we waiting for?

921
00:51:39,723 --> 00:51:41,976
We're coming
for you, baby!

922
00:51:54,905 --> 00:51:57,116
Lower the ramp,
dummy.

923
00:51:57,700 --> 00:51:59,201
Who are they?

924
00:51:59,326 --> 00:52:02,162
This is Puffball,
Squash-Face,

925
00:52:02,329 --> 00:52:04,164
Weiner Dog,
Yellow Bird,

926
00:52:04,331 --> 00:52:06,875
Eagle-Eye,
Guinea Pig Joe.

927
00:52:07,042 --> 00:52:08,877
And, of course,
my girlfriend Rhonda.

928
00:52:09,253 --> 00:52:11,714
100% wrong.

929
00:52:12,673 --> 00:52:14,091
Good enough.

930
00:52:15,384 --> 00:52:17,845
Come on! Let's go!
Move it or lose it!

931
00:52:17,970 --> 00:52:20,264
Every bird instinct
I have says

932
00:52:20,431 --> 00:52:22,683
don't follow a dog
on wheels.

933
00:52:22,766 --> 00:52:24,727
Um, Mr. Pops, sir.

934
00:52:24,893 --> 00:52:27,187
Shouldn't we be
heading to the sewers?

935
00:52:27,313 --> 00:52:28,772
Now, if we take
the human route,

936
00:52:28,897 --> 00:52:30,399
getting there is
gonna take days.

937
00:52:30,566 --> 00:52:31,734
You may have lots of time,

938
00:52:31,900 --> 00:52:33,902
but for me every breath
is a cliffhanger.

939
00:52:34,069 --> 00:52:37,031
So, we gotta take
the secret route.

940
00:52:38,991 --> 00:52:41,618
Okay. The secret
route was death.

941
00:52:41,785 --> 00:52:43,245
Well, that's that,
I guess.

942
00:52:43,370 --> 00:52:44,413
Come on!

943
00:52:46,915 --> 00:52:48,417
Get down here!

944
00:52:53,130 --> 00:52:54,590
Sweetpea...

945
00:53:06,435 --> 00:53:08,103
Keep moving!

946
00:53:18,739 --> 00:53:19,782
Oh, no.

947
00:53:23,077 --> 00:53:25,287
Stop it! Look away!

948
00:54:07,788 --> 00:54:09,957
Come on! I don't
have all day!

949
00:54:20,342 --> 00:54:21,844
Yeah!

950
00:54:27,683 --> 00:54:28,684
Wheel

951
00:54:37,985 --> 00:54:39,695
Come on, slowpokes!

952
00:54:40,487 --> 00:54:42,030
Ugh! What is
that smell?

953
00:54:42,197 --> 00:54:44,867
It's poo-poo
with a dash of caca.

954
00:54:46,535 --> 00:54:47,911
The scent is
getting stronger.

955
00:54:54,209 --> 00:54:55,502
Oh, man.

956
00:55:00,841 --> 00:55:03,093
Duke, let's eat!

957
00:55:03,260 --> 00:55:04,678
Oh, yes!

958
00:55:14,521 --> 00:55:16,565
Oh, it smells
so good!

959
00:55:18,066 --> 00:55:20,527
Oh yes!

960
00:55:29,411 --> 00:55:31,288
Sausages!

961
00:55:33,415 --> 00:55:34,416
Ah!

962
00:55:52,935 --> 00:55:54,937
Come on, boys!

963
00:55:59,650 --> 00:56:02,027
Holy schnitzel!

964
00:56:04,821 --> 00:56:08,951
<i>We go together
Like rama lama lama
ka dinga da dinga dong</i>

965
00:56:09,117 --> 00:56:10,869
<i>Remembered forever</i>

966
00:56:10,994 --> 00:56:13,539
<i>As shoo-bop sha wadda wadda

968
00:56:15,999 --> 00:56:19,461
<i>That's the way it should be</i>

969
00:56:19,628 --> 00:56:21,505
<i>Wha-oooh, yeah!</i>

970
00:56:22,214 --> 00:56:26,510
<i>We're for each other
Like a wop ba-ba

971
00:56:26,593 --> 00:56:28,345
<i>Just like my brother is</i>

<i>Sha-na-na-na-na-na-na-na

00:56:36,645 --> 00:56:38,772
<i>Wha-oooh, yeah!</i>

976
00:56:55,664 --> 00:56:57,958
Getting
a weird vibe, man.

977
00:57:00,502 --> 00:57:02,838
All right, now,
these guys
are a bit testy.

978
00:57:03,005 --> 00:57:04,965
So, just let me
do the talking.

979
00:57:05,090 --> 00:57:08,510
Hey, you crybaby!
Where's the Viper at?

980
00:57:15,851 --> 00:57:17,644
Don't you worry,
Viper!

981
00:57:17,811 --> 00:57:20,522
You will not
be forgotten!

982
00:57:21,356 --> 00:57:24,401
You will be avenged, Viper!

983
00:57:25,027 --> 00:57:26,695
If you don't believe me,

984
00:57:26,862 --> 00:57:28,405
you can look at
my battle plans.

985
00:57:28,572 --> 00:57:30,365
It's all laid out right here.

986
00:57:32,034 --> 00:57:33,535
Uh, boss...

987
00:57:33,702 --> 00:57:35,871
I can't tell
who anyone is.

988
00:57:36,038 --> 00:57:38,165
Well, you gotta really
look at it to understand it.

989
00:57:38,290 --> 00:57:40,417
That's you guys right here.

990
00:57:40,584 --> 00:57:41,877
And, see, that's Brooklyn.

991
00:57:42,044 --> 00:57:43,920
That's where we
gonna get them dogs.

992
00:57:44,129 --> 00:57:45,589
Bam! Bam!

993
00:57:48,216 --> 00:57:50,844
That ball of fluff's
got a screw loose.

994
00:57:51,011 --> 00:57:52,346
Let's skedaddle.

995
00:57:52,512 --> 00:57:53,912
You get it,
you see what I'm saying.

996
00:57:54,014 --> 00:57:56,433
Bottom line is, I'm coming
right for you, Tiny Dog!

997
00:57:56,600 --> 00:57:59,394
And that big, fat, brown dog?
He gonna get it, too.

998
00:57:59,561 --> 00:58:00,604
Tiny Dog?

999
00:58:00,771 --> 00:58:02,731
There are lots of
tiny dogs in the city.

1000
00:58:02,898 --> 00:58:05,192
I mean, you're
a tiny dog, okay?
So, let's just go.

1001
00:58:05,359 --> 00:58:07,736
He also said,
"big, fat, brown dog."

1002
00:58:07,903 --> 00:58:09,738
Like Max's new roommate.

1003
00:58:09,905 --> 00:58:10,989
Not necessarily.

1004
00:58:11,573 --> 00:58:14,034
Max, Max, Max...

1005
00:58:14,201 --> 00:58:15,952
You are gonna get it!

1006
00:58:16,495 --> 00:58:18,622
That's kind
of hard to dispute.

1007
00:58:18,789 --> 00:58:21,458
Hey, you stay away
from...

1008
00:58:21,833 --> 00:58:22,834
Wait, what?

1009
00:58:22,918 --> 00:58:23,919
You know Tiny Dog?

1010
00:58:25,629 --> 00:58:27,089
He's my friend!

1011
00:58:27,255 --> 00:58:29,257
And some might
say my boyfriend!

1012
00:58:29,341 --> 00:58:30,801
Uh, nobody says that.

1013
00:58:30,967 --> 00:58:32,761
I can't believe
you know Tiny Dog!

1014
00:58:32,928 --> 00:58:34,368
That's cool.
It's such a small world,

1015
00:58:34,429 --> 00:58:36,139
that's the funny
thing about it.

1016
00:58:36,556 --> 00:58:37,557
Get them!

1017
00:58:37,683 --> 00:58:38,975
Scatter!

1018
00:58:44,773 --> 00:58:45,774
Not good!

1019
00:58:50,570 --> 00:58:51,655
See you guys later!

1020
00:58:51,780 --> 00:58:52,781
Hang on!

1021
00:58:56,952 --> 00:58:58,620
Everybody, run!

1022
00:59:03,542 --> 00:59:04,835
Derick, you idiot!

1023
00:59:05,001 --> 00:59:06,211
Did they all get away?

1024
00:59:06,878 --> 00:59:07,879
Uh...

1025
00:59:08,463 --> 00:59:10,674
Phew! That was
a close one!

1026
00:59:11,967 --> 00:59:13,510
Oh, nuts!

1027
00:59:13,635 --> 00:59:15,762
Yes! We got one!

1028
00:59:16,304 --> 00:59:17,848
Oh, good for you guys!

1029
00:59:18,014 --> 00:59:19,641
Yay!
Yeah!

1030
00:59:19,808 --> 00:59:21,560
Oh, yes, Tiny Dog,

1031
00:59:21,727 --> 00:59:23,228
we got your friend!

1032
00:59:23,395 --> 00:59:25,188
Advantage, me!

1033
00:59:27,232 --> 00:59:30,569
Uh-oh. Just ignore what
just happened. Okay?

1034
00:59:32,821 --> 00:59:33,905
Yes!

1035
00:59:38,744 --> 00:59:40,120
You know what?

1036
00:59:40,203 --> 00:59:42,581
This may be the
sausage talking,

1037
00:59:42,664 --> 00:59:43,999
but you're okay.

1038
00:59:44,082 --> 00:59:46,126
Right back
at you, man.

1039
00:59:46,251 --> 00:59:48,253
When I met you,
I was all like,

1040
00:59:48,336 --> 00:59:50,839
"I don't know
if I like him."

1041
00:59:51,006 --> 00:59:53,175
But now that
I know you, I'm like,

1042
00:59:53,341 --> 00:59:55,177
"I like him."

1043
00:59:56,928 --> 00:59:59,848
You know, I saw this
place from the outside

1044
01:00:00,015 --> 01:00:01,349
many times.

1045
01:00:01,475 --> 01:00:05,562
Had I known what treasures
awaited within these walls,

1046
01:00:05,687 --> 01:00:07,439
I would've
broke down that door

1047
01:00:07,522 --> 01:00:09,357
a long time ago,
I'll tell you!

1048
01:00:09,941 --> 01:00:11,526
What are you
talking about?

1049
01:00:11,693 --> 01:00:13,987
My old owner and I
used to live around here.

1050
01:00:14,112 --> 01:00:15,614
Duke, man, wait.

1051
01:00:15,697 --> 01:00:17,240
Did you used
to have an owner?

1052
01:00:17,365 --> 01:00:20,368
Well, it was
a long time ago.

1053
01:00:20,535 --> 01:00:21,828
I don't want
to talk about it.

1054
01:00:21,953 --> 01:00:23,663
Yes, you do.
Come on.

1055
01:00:24,372 --> 01:00:26,124
I don't know.

1056
01:00:26,583 --> 01:00:27,876
But you know what?

1057
01:00:28,877 --> 01:00:30,962
He was so cool.

1058
01:00:31,087 --> 01:00:32,339
Yeah?

1059
01:00:32,923 --> 01:00:34,132
Yeah.

1060
01:00:34,299 --> 01:00:36,134
He was the best.

1061
01:00:49,231 --> 01:00:50,649
<i>Man, we had fun.</i>

1062
01:00:53,568 --> 01:00:55,070
<i>We'd play fetch.</i>

1063
01:01:01,326 --> 01:01:03,078
<i>We'd go for walks.</i>

1064
01:01:05,080 --> 01:01:06,832
<i>We'd take naps.</i>

1065
01:01:07,666 --> 01:01:09,501
<i>We were both big nappers.</i>

1066
01:01:23,431 --> 01:01:27,269
I got out one night,
chasing a butterfly,
or a car.

1067
01:01:27,435 --> 01:01:29,813
By the time I had
caught up with it
and ate it...

1068
01:01:29,980 --> 01:01:31,439
Probably a butterfly,
then.

1069
01:01:31,606 --> 01:01:34,359
...I realized I was so
far away from my home

1070
01:01:34,526 --> 01:01:36,278
I couldn't find it.

1071
01:01:36,695 --> 01:01:39,865
A few days later,
I was picked up
by Animal Control.

1072
01:01:41,825 --> 01:01:45,328
I had
a great thing going.

1073
01:01:46,872 --> 01:01:48,790
But I had to go
and mess it up.

1074
01:01:50,458 --> 01:01:52,168
Duke, we gotta go
to your house.

1075
01:01:52,294 --> 01:01:53,545
Nah.

1076
01:01:53,712 --> 01:01:55,881
Your owner's gonna
be relieved!

1077
01:01:56,047 --> 01:01:57,090
Will he?

1078
01:01:57,215 --> 01:01:58,216
Yeah, but...

1079
01:01:58,300 --> 01:02:00,302
But he never
came for me.

1080
01:02:01,177 --> 01:02:02,637
Maybe he...

1081
01:02:03,471 --> 01:02:05,390
Maybe he didn't like me.

1082
01:02:05,515 --> 01:02:08,351
Of course he liked you.
He was your owner.

1083
01:02:08,518 --> 01:02:10,770
I mean, he's probably
worried sick!

1084
01:02:10,896 --> 01:02:12,314
I don't know.

1085
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:14,316
Well, I do know
and we're going!

1086
01:02:14,482 --> 01:02:15,650
Your owner's
gonna freak!

1087
01:02:15,734 --> 01:02:17,736
I'm freaking out
just thinking about it.

1088
01:02:19,988 --> 01:02:20,989
Okay.

1089
01:02:21,823 --> 01:02:23,074
Let's do it!

1090
01:02:23,241 --> 01:02:24,326
There they are!

1091
01:02:25,035 --> 01:02:26,244
All right, doggy,
come on.

1092
01:02:28,330 --> 01:02:29,748
Hey, hey, hey!

1093
01:02:29,831 --> 01:02:31,207
Where do you
think you're going?

1094
01:02:31,333 --> 01:02:33,335
Come back here, you dogs!

1095
01:02:44,930 --> 01:02:46,014
That rabbit...

1096
01:02:46,181 --> 01:02:47,515
He had crazy eyes.

1097
01:02:47,682 --> 01:02:50,101
There ain't no curing
what's wrong
with that thing!

1098
01:02:50,268 --> 01:02:52,562
Gidget,
here's an idea.

1099
01:02:52,687 --> 01:02:56,691
Maybe there's a dog
in the neighborhood
that looks like Max.

1100
01:02:56,858 --> 01:02:58,693
Start hanging out with him.

1101
01:02:58,860 --> 01:03:00,695
After a while,
you'll think it's him

1102
01:03:00,820 --> 01:03:02,155
you'll be done.

1103
01:03:02,322 --> 01:03:04,366
We are not
just giving up!

1104
01:03:04,491 --> 01:03:05,700
We're dedicated.
We're loyal.

1105
01:03:05,867 --> 01:03:07,494
We're easily the
greatest pet ever.

1106
01:03:07,661 --> 01:03:08,703
We're dogs!

1107
01:03:08,828 --> 01:03:10,205
Cat.
Hawk.

1108
01:03:11,539 --> 01:03:12,582
Well, congratulations!

1109
01:03:12,749 --> 01:03:14,834
Today you're dogs,
whether you like it
or not!

1110
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:16,002
Sweet.

1111
01:03:16,127 --> 01:03:18,672
Now let's find Max
before that rabbit does!

1112
01:03:18,838 --> 01:03:21,174
Break! We're dogs!

1113
01:03:25,387 --> 01:03:26,388
Oh.

1114
01:03:26,471 --> 01:03:28,348
I don't like it.

1115
01:03:29,557 --> 01:03:31,351
Sassafras...

1116
01:03:36,564 --> 01:03:38,608
Yep, they were here.

1117
01:03:38,775 --> 01:03:41,069
Excellent.
We're closing in!

1118
01:03:41,236 --> 01:03:43,530
This is groundbreaking
evil behavior, people.

1119
01:03:44,322 --> 01:03:45,323
Groundbreaking!

1120
01:03:53,498 --> 01:03:54,499
Oh!

1121
01:03:54,874 --> 01:03:57,002
A light bulb just
went off in my brain.

1122
01:03:57,168 --> 01:03:59,212
The bunny has an idea.

1123
01:04:02,382 --> 01:04:04,134
Okay, so, uh,
how do I look?

1124
01:04:04,300 --> 01:04:05,760
You look great.

1125
01:04:06,261 --> 01:04:07,929
How do I smell?

1126
01:04:08,096 --> 01:04:09,431
Like a dog, Duke.

1127
01:04:09,597 --> 01:04:10,765
Relax, man.

1128
01:04:13,768 --> 01:04:15,478
There it is.

1129
01:04:18,565 --> 01:04:20,275
Well, go on up.

1130
01:04:20,442 --> 01:04:21,901
Go scratch
at that door.

1131
01:04:27,115 --> 01:04:30,535
Remember that
sausage factory?
That was fun, huh?

1132
01:04:30,702 --> 01:04:31,953
Are you stalling?

1133
01:04:32,078 --> 01:04:34,748
No. Why do you
think that?

1134
01:04:34,914 --> 01:04:37,250
Let's have a long
talk about why you
think I'm stalling.

1135
01:04:37,333 --> 01:04:39,294
Duke, you have nothing
to be nervous about.

1136
01:04:39,461 --> 01:04:41,379
Your owner is going to
be thrilled to see you.

1137
01:04:44,549 --> 01:04:45,759
Okay.

1138
01:04:49,512 --> 01:04:52,390
Huh. That car is new.

1139
01:04:59,898 --> 01:05:01,733
Can I help you?

1140
01:05:04,027 --> 01:05:06,112
No. We're good, thanks.

1141
01:05:06,237 --> 01:05:08,114
You're not good.
You look dirty.

1142
01:05:08,281 --> 01:05:10,450
And I'm gonna
have to ask you
to get off my lawn

1143
01:05:10,617 --> 01:05:12,327
before I get, um,

1144
01:05:12,494 --> 01:05:14,287
what you have.

1145
01:05:14,412 --> 01:05:15,914
This is my lawn.

1146
01:05:16,081 --> 01:05:17,832
Duke, maybe
we should go.

1147
01:05:17,999 --> 01:05:20,543
And why would
Fred get a cat?

1148
01:05:20,710 --> 01:05:22,003
He hates cats.

1149
01:05:22,170 --> 01:05:23,838
That's one of the things
I love about him.

1150
01:05:24,005 --> 01:05:26,591
Fred? The old guy?

1151
01:05:27,133 --> 01:05:28,510
He, um...

1152
01:05:29,761 --> 01:05:31,471
He died.

1153
01:05:33,056 --> 01:05:35,642
Duke, maybe I made
a mistake, saying
we should come here.

1154
01:05:35,725 --> 01:05:37,227
Let's go.

1155
01:05:37,602 --> 01:05:39,187
You're a liar!

1156
01:05:39,354 --> 01:05:41,314
Max, cats lie
all the time.

1157
01:05:41,439 --> 01:05:42,941
Don't fall for it!

1158
01:05:48,363 --> 01:05:49,614
Who are they?

1159
01:05:53,076 --> 01:05:54,619
Hey, this is my home.

1160
01:05:54,911 --> 01:05:55,912
Go away!

1161
01:06:00,708 --> 01:06:02,669
Duke, it's time
to go.

1162
01:06:04,754 --> 01:06:06,464
Duke, let's go!
Come on!

1163
01:06:06,631 --> 01:06:08,341
This isn't your home
anymore.

1164
01:06:08,466 --> 01:06:10,802
Why did you
bring me here, Max?

1165
01:06:10,927 --> 01:06:12,929
Wait a minute.
This is my fault?

1166
01:06:13,096 --> 01:06:14,597
I was trying
to help you!

1167
01:06:14,722 --> 01:06:16,933
You were trying
to get rid of me!

1168
01:06:18,351 --> 01:06:20,311
You know what, Duke?
I don't need this.

1169
01:06:21,146 --> 01:06:22,147
I'll see you later.

1170
01:06:22,230 --> 01:06:23,231
Gotcha!

1171
01:06:24,649 --> 01:06:26,442
Come on, settle down!

1172
01:06:29,195 --> 01:06:30,738
Go home, Max!

1173
01:06:31,990 --> 01:06:33,408
Hey, help me out, here!

1174
01:06:33,533 --> 01:06:35,451
Hold on!
I'm coming!

1175
01:06:36,411 --> 01:06:37,620
Let's go.

1176
01:06:39,080 --> 01:06:40,415
Finally
got you, big fella.

1177
01:06:40,582 --> 01:06:41,742
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Come on.

1178
01:06:41,791 --> 01:06:43,710
This is it for you.

1179
01:06:49,841 --> 01:06:50,925
Duke!

1180
01:07:16,159 --> 01:07:17,160
Aw.

1181
01:07:17,785 --> 01:07:19,412
Koochi koochi koo!

1182
01:07:33,051 --> 01:07:34,177
Tiny Dog!

1183
01:07:36,721 --> 01:07:38,348
Ah, are you kidding me?

1184
01:07:38,973 --> 01:07:41,351
You thought
this was over, Tiny Dog?

1185
01:07:45,813 --> 01:07:47,065
Stop!

1186
01:07:47,941 --> 01:07:48,942
Huh?

1187
01:07:52,570 --> 01:07:53,571
Jab, jab, jab!

1188
01:07:53,738 --> 01:07:54,822
Body blow! Body blow!

1189
01:07:54,989 --> 01:07:56,741
Karate chop to your neck!

1190
01:07:57,867 --> 01:07:59,661
Would you get off me!

1191
01:08:01,996 --> 01:08:03,206
Tattoo!

1192
01:08:05,667 --> 01:08:07,835
No, no, no.

1193
01:08:13,174 --> 01:08:14,801
Oh, TD.

1194
01:08:14,968 --> 01:08:16,511
This kills me to say,

1195
01:08:16,678 --> 01:08:18,680
but we gotta
join forces, man.

1196
01:08:29,482 --> 01:08:30,483
Whoo!

1197
01:08:31,234 --> 01:08:33,361
We make a great team,
Tiny Dog!

1198
01:08:33,528 --> 01:08:36,864
Well, mainly,
I'm doing all the hard work,
but you're helping!

1199
01:08:36,990 --> 01:08:38,074
Yes, yes, fine.

1200
01:08:38,241 --> 01:08:40,681
Just keep your eyes
on the road. You're
driving like an animal!

1201
01:08:41,536 --> 01:08:42,704
Whoo-hoo!

1202
01:08:43,496 --> 01:08:45,039
What was that?

1203
01:08:45,164 --> 01:08:46,791
Oh, that was a pothole.

1204
01:08:46,916 --> 01:08:48,543
You're hitting
things on purpose!

1205
01:08:48,710 --> 01:08:51,045
Heh. You know me
too well, TD!

1206
01:08:51,212 --> 01:08:53,047
Always keeping me
in check.

1207
01:09:00,805 --> 01:09:01,973
Do you see the van?

1208
01:09:02,140 --> 01:09:03,224
Yeah, I see it.

1209
01:09:03,391 --> 01:09:05,018
We're about to hit it.

1210
01:09:30,335 --> 01:09:32,086
Relax, Snowball,
I got you.

1211
01:09:32,211 --> 01:09:33,796
There he is!

1212
01:09:33,921 --> 01:09:35,757
He's got Snowball!

1213
01:09:52,690 --> 01:09:55,902
Look, fellas, this is
not what this looks like.

1214
01:09:56,027 --> 01:09:57,570
Shush, you!

1215
01:09:59,155 --> 01:10:00,907
You were gonna
eat the boss!

1216
01:10:01,032 --> 01:10:03,409
No, no, no.
Snowball and I are
on the same side now.

1217
01:10:03,576 --> 01:10:05,745
Tell them! Snowball,
tell them!

1218
01:10:05,912 --> 01:10:08,039
That raccoon is lying.

1219
01:10:08,206 --> 01:10:10,083
He's not the president.

1220
01:10:15,755 --> 01:10:16,756
Come on, now.

1221
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:19,133
Come here, you.

1222
01:10:28,434 --> 01:10:29,477
Gidget?

1223
01:11:05,054 --> 01:11:06,264
Go, Max!

1224
01:11:06,431 --> 01:11:07,807
Right. Okay,
gotta go.

1225
01:11:07,974 --> 01:11:09,392
Thank you! Thank you!

1226
01:11:10,852 --> 01:11:12,228
Stay down!

1227
01:11:26,701 --> 01:11:28,161
Duke, hang on!

1228
01:11:29,036 --> 01:11:30,037
Whoa!

1229
01:11:43,551 --> 01:11:44,552
Duke!

1230
01:11:44,635 --> 01:11:45,845
Max? Max!

1231
01:11:45,970 --> 01:11:47,805
Oh, get
the keys!
Right!

1232
01:11:47,972 --> 01:11:49,390
Hurry!
Ha!

1233
01:12:21,797 --> 01:12:23,466
Come on, come on.

1234
01:12:23,591 --> 01:12:25,301
I got them!

1235
01:12:28,596 --> 01:12:29,722
Max!

1236
01:13:04,215 --> 01:13:06,717
Remember me!

1237
01:13:59,186 --> 01:14:00,896
I feel heroic!

1238
01:14:01,063 --> 01:14:02,440
And handsome.

1239
01:14:02,607 --> 01:14:04,483
I'm a little wet,
but I still look good.

1240
01:14:04,650 --> 01:14:06,360
I look good.

1241
01:14:11,449 --> 01:14:12,491
Are you...

1242
01:14:12,783 --> 01:14:14,035
Are you okay?

1243
01:14:14,160 --> 01:14:15,369
I'm good.

1244
01:14:15,703 --> 01:14:16,746
I'm good.

1245
01:14:18,372 --> 01:14:20,291
Thanks for coming
to save me, Max.

1246
01:14:23,127 --> 01:14:24,587
Max!

1247
01:14:24,712 --> 01:14:26,047
Oh, Max!

1248
01:14:32,553 --> 01:14:33,888
You need a lift?

1249
01:14:34,639 --> 01:14:36,057
Yes, we need a lift!

1250
01:14:36,265 --> 01:14:37,558
Let's go, Tattoo.

1251
01:14:42,688 --> 01:14:44,273
Taxi!

1252
01:14:44,607 --> 01:14:45,650
Whoa!

1253
01:15:02,416 --> 01:15:03,417
Yeah!

1254
01:15:03,959 --> 01:15:05,419
Hey, hey...

1255
01:15:05,795 --> 01:15:07,088
Uh, Gidget, wait up.

1256
01:15:07,254 --> 01:15:08,881
Oh, hi, Max.

1257
01:15:08,964 --> 01:15:09,965
Yeah. Hi. Um...

1258
01:15:10,049 --> 01:15:12,009
Play it cool.

1259
01:15:12,468 --> 01:15:14,095
Yeah, I...

1260
01:15:14,261 --> 01:15:15,888
I just wanted to...

1261
01:15:16,097 --> 01:15:17,556
Look...

1262
01:15:18,808 --> 01:15:21,310
Have you ever lived across
from someone your whole life,

1263
01:15:21,811 --> 01:15:24,105
but you don't really
appreciate them, until...

1264
01:15:25,356 --> 01:15:26,399
I don't know...

1265
01:15:26,482 --> 01:15:29,402
Until they're beating up
dozens of animals
on the Brooklyn Bridge?

1266
01:15:29,860 --> 01:15:31,404
I guess what I'm
trying to say is...

1267
01:15:32,154 --> 01:15:33,739
If you ever wanna...

1268
01:15:33,823 --> 01:15:34,824
Okay.

1269
01:15:34,949 --> 01:15:36,534
Oh, great.
You're in love.

1270
01:15:36,701 --> 01:15:39,036
How gross for everyone.
Now move it!

1271
01:15:39,203 --> 01:15:40,788
Good-bye!
See you later!
Good-bye!

1272
01:15:40,955 --> 01:15:42,665
Does anyone know
where we are?

1273
01:15:42,832 --> 01:15:43,833
Bye, Max.

1274
01:15:43,999 --> 01:15:45,042
Bye, Gidget.

1275
01:15:45,209 --> 01:15:46,460
Okay, bye-bye!

1276
01:15:46,627 --> 01:15:47,962
See you guys-

1277
01:15:48,462 --> 01:15:50,297
Man, I feel sorry
for them.

1278
01:15:50,464 --> 01:15:52,466
Gotta run home
to their owners.

1279
01:15:52,633 --> 01:15:53,634
Not us.

1280
01:15:53,801 --> 01:15:56,637
Now, it's back to
our primary mission.

1281
01:15:56,804 --> 01:15:59,515
The downfall of
the human race!

1282
01:15:59,682 --> 01:16:01,308
It is on, humans!

1283
01:16:01,475 --> 01:16:03,185
It is on!

1284
01:16:03,310 --> 01:16:04,478
Yeah!

1285
01:16:05,855 --> 01:16:08,149
Mommy! Can I have a bunny?

1286
01:16:09,400 --> 01:16:12,069
And a pig and
a crocodile
and a lizard?

1287
01:16:15,072 --> 01:16:16,073
Uh-oh.

1288
01:16:16,157 --> 01:16:17,700
Yay, bunny!

1289
01:16:18,492 --> 01:16:19,618
Jab, jab, jab!

1290
01:16:19,702 --> 01:16:21,996
- Body blow! Body blow!
- Break-away move.

1291
01:16:22,496 --> 01:16:23,497
Aww...

1292
01:16:24,290 --> 01:16:25,475
What's going on?
What's she doing?

1293
01:16:25,499 --> 01:16:29,003
Bunny, I'm gonna love you
forever and ever and ever.

1294
01:16:31,130 --> 01:16:32,923
Aww. Bunny.

1295
01:18:04,598 --> 01:18:06,976
Aw.

1296
01:18:07,059 --> 01:18:08,519
Here you go.

1297
01:18:48,559 --> 01:18:51,103
Duke, this
is the best
part of the day.

1298
01:18:51,979 --> 01:18:53,230
Ooh! Is that her?

1299
01:18:53,397 --> 01:18:55,232
Nah, no.
That's... Wait...

1300
01:18:55,399 --> 01:18:56,817
Yeah, that's her.
That's her.

1301
01:18:58,527 --> 01:19:00,070
Katie!

1302
01:19:00,779 --> 01:19:02,114
There they are!

1303
01:19:02,239 --> 01:19:05,492
Max and Duke,
Duke and Max! Aw!

1304
01:19:05,576 --> 01:19:07,202
My boys!

1305
01:19:07,620 --> 01:19:10,247
So, how'd it go?
Great, right? I...

1306
01:19:11,248 --> 01:19:12,249
Uh...

1307
01:19:13,876 --> 01:19:16,003
So, maybe a few bumps.

1308
01:19:16,170 --> 01:19:18,631
But I knew this
was gonna work out.

1309
01:19:19,048 --> 01:19:21,050
So, who's hungry?

1310
01:19:33,687 --> 01:19:35,606
Welcome home, Duke.

1311
01:19:36,106 --> 01:19:37,441
Thanks, Max.

1312
01:20:49,096 --> 01:20:50,848
Come on, man.
Hurry it up.

1313
01:20:50,931 --> 01:20:52,599
Okay.

1314
01:20:52,725 --> 01:20:54,518
I'm coming,
I'm coming.

1315
01:20:54,601 --> 01:20:55,602
Sheesh!

1316
01:20:59,314 --> 01:21:01,108
Welcome, my dogs.

1317
01:21:01,608 --> 01:21:02,943
Oh, you guys
look weird.

1318
01:21:03,110 --> 01:21:04,153
Hurry up, come on in.

1319
01:21:09,616 --> 01:21:11,785
You said it was
a costume party.

1320
01:21:11,952 --> 01:21:13,287
Why do you
listen to me?

1321
01:21:23,005 --> 01:21:24,548
I'm home, Leonard.

1322
01:21:31,972 --> 01:21:34,266
Were you
a good boy, Leonard?

1323
01:26:23,096 --> 01:26:25,515
<i>All right, party's over.</i>
